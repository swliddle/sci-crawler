They remained close throughout my father\u2019s life, and occasionally Coach and Mrs. Wooden would come to our home for dinner. He was always happy to talk to me about basketball or anything else on my mind. Once I asked him what advice he had for me as I entered my senior year of high school. Always the teacher, he said, \u201cYour father told me that you have joined the Church of Jesus Christ, so I know that you have faith in the Lord. With that faith be sure to have poise in every situation. Be a good man in a storm.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444059\" id=\"p3\">Over the years, that conversation stuck with me. That counsel to be calm, cool, and collected in all situations, particularly in times of adversity and pressure, resonated with me. I could see how Coach Wooden\u2019s teams played with poise and the great success that they experienced winning 10 national championships.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444063\" id=\"p4\">But poise is not spoken about much these days and practiced even less in turbulent and divisive times. It is often referenced in sports\u2014a player with poise is unflappable in a close game, or a team unravels due to a lack of poise. But this wonderful quality goes way beyond sports. Poise has a much broader application to life and can bless parents, leaders, missionaries, teachers, students, and everyone else facing the storms of life.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444067\" id=\"p5\">Spiritual poise blesses us to stay calm and focused on what matters most, especially when we are under pressure. President Hugh B. Brown taught, \u201cFaith in God and in the ultimate triumph of right contributes to mental and spiritual poise in the face of difficulties.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\">1<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444071\" id=\"p6\">President Russell M. Nelson is a wonderful example of spiritual poise. One time, while then-Dr. Nelson was performing a quadruple coronary artery bypass, the patient\u2019s blood pressure dropped suddenly. Dr. Nelson calmly assessed the situation and identified that a clamp was accidentally removed by one of the team members. It was replaced immediately, and Dr. Nelson comforted the team member, saying, \u201cI still love you,\u201d and then added jokingly, \u201cSometimes I love you more than other times!\u201d He showed how an emergency should be handled\u2014with poise, focused only on what matters most\u2014addressing the emergency. President Nelson said: \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of extreme self-discipline. Your natural reaction is, \u2018Take me out, coach! I want to go home.\u2019 But of course you can\u2019t. A life is totally dependent on the whole surgical team. So you\u2019ve got to stay just as calm and relaxed and sharp as you ever were.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\">2<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444077\" id=\"p7\">Of course, the Savior is the ultimate example of poise.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444083\" id=\"p8\">In the Garden of Gethsemane, in unimaginable agony, as \u201che sweat as it were great drops of blood,\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\">3<\/sup><\/a> He exemplified divine poise with the simple yet majestic statement \u201cNot my will, but thine, be done.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\">4<\/sup><\/a> Under the immense pressure to enable the salvation of all humankind, Jesus demonstrated three important conditions that help us understand His great poise. First, He knew who He was and was true to His divine mission. Next, He knew that there was a great plan of happiness. And finally, He knew that through His infinite Atonement, all who faithfully yoke themselves to Him by making and keeping sacred covenants received through priesthood ordinances will be saved, as was so beautifully taught by Elder Dale G. Renlund today.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444089\" id=\"p9\">To contrast the difference between losing and maintaining poise, think about what happened as Christ and His Apostles left the Garden of Gethsemane. When confronted by soldiers seeking to arrest Jesus, Peter\u2019s reaction was to lose his poise and lash out violently by cutting off the ear of the high priest\u2019s servant, Malchus. Jesus Christ\u2019s reaction, on the other hand, was to keep His poise and to bring calm to a tense situation by healing Malchus.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\">5<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445096\" id=\"p10\">And for those of us who struggle with maintaining our poise and perhaps have grown discouraged, consider the rest of Peter\u2019s story. A short time after this incident and the heartbreak of denying his association with Christ,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\">6<\/sup><\/a> Peter stood before the very same religious leaders who condemned the Savior, and with great poise under intense questioning, he bore eloquent testimony of the divinity of Jesus Christ.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\">7<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"154445103\" id=\"p11\">Know Who You Are and Be True to Your Divine Identity<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"154445110\" id=\"p12\">Let\u2019s consider elements of Christlike poise. To begin, knowing who we are and being true to our divine identity brings calm. Christlike poise requires that we avoid comparing ourselves to others or pretending to be someone we\u2019re not.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\">8<\/sup><\/a> Joseph Smith taught, \u201cIf men do not comprehend the character of God, they do not comprehend themselves.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\">9<\/sup><\/a> It is just not possible to have divine poise without knowing that we are divine sons and daughters of a loving Heavenly Father.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445118\" id=\"p22\">In his talk \u201cChoices for Eternity,\u201d President Nelson taught these eternal truths about who we are: we are children of God, we are children of the covenant, and we are disciples of Christ. He then promised, \u201cAs you embrace these truths, our Heavenly Father will help you reach your ultimate goal of living eternally in His holy presence.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\">10<\/sup><\/a> We truly are divine spiritual beings having a mortal experience. Knowing who we are and being true to that divine identity are foundational to the development of Christlike poise.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"154445126\" id=\"p13\">Know That There Is a Divine Plan<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"154445135\" id=\"p14\">Next, remembering that there is a grand plan engenders courage and poise in challenging conditions. Nephi could \u201cgo and do\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\">11<\/sup><\/a> as the Lord commanded \u201cnot knowing beforehand\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\">12<\/sup><\/a> the things that he was to do because he knew that he would be led by the Spirit, in fulfillment of the eternal plan of a loving Heavenly Father. Poise comes when we see things from an eternal perspective. The Lord has counseled His disciples to \u201clift up your eyes\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\">13<\/sup><\/a> and to \u201clet the solemnities of eternity rest upon your minds.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note14\"><sup class=\"marker\">14<\/sup><\/a> By framing challenging times within an eternal plan, pressure becomes a privilege to love, serve, teach, and bless. An eternal view enables Christlike poise.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"154445144\" id=\"p15\">Know the Enabling Power of Jesus Christ and His Atonement<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"154445152\" id=\"p16\">And finally, the enabling power of Christ, made possible by His atoning sacrifice, gives us the strength to endure and prevail. Because of Jesus Christ we can covenant with God and be strengthened in keeping that covenant. We can be bound to the Savior in joy and calm, regardless of our temporal circumstances.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note15\"><sup class=\"marker\">15<\/sup><\/a> <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/7?lang=eng\">Alma chapter 7<\/a> teaches beautifully about Christ\u2019s enabling power. In addition to redeeming us from sin, the Savior can strengthen us in our weaknesses, fears, and challenges in this life.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445159\" id=\"p23\">As we focus on Christ, we can hush our fears, as Alma\u2019s people did in Helam.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note16\"><sup class=\"marker\">16<\/sup><\/a> As a threatening army gathered, those faithful disciples of Christ demonstrated poise. Elder David A. Bednar has taught: \u201cAlma counseled the believers to remember the Lord and the deliverance only He could bestow (see 2 Nephi 2:8). And knowledge of the Savior\u2019s protecting watchcare enabled the people to hush their own fears.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note17\"><sup class=\"marker\">17<\/sup><\/a> This exemplifies poise.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"154445167\" id=\"p17\">The Great Man in a Storm<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"154445177\" id=\"p18\">Noah taught us much about patience in a storm, but the Savior was the greatest teacher on how to survive a storm. He is the great man in a storm. After a long day of teaching with His Apostles, the Savior needed some rest and suggested that they cross by boat to the other side of the Sea of Galilee. As the Savior rested, a severe storm arose. As the wind and waves threatened to sink the boat, the Apostles began to fear for their lives. And remember, several of those Apostles were fishermen who were very well acquainted with the storms on that sea! Yet, worried,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note18\"><sup class=\"marker\">18<\/sup><\/a> they woke the Lord and asked, \u201c[Lord], carest thou not that we perish?\u201d Then, with exemplary poise, the Savior \u201carose, and rebuked the wind, and said unto the sea, Peace, be still. And the wind ceased, and there was \u2026 great calm.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note19\"><sup class=\"marker\">19<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445187\" id=\"p19\">And then a great lesson in poise for His Apostles. He asked, \u201cWhy are ye so fearful? how is it that ye have no faith?\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note20\"><sup class=\"marker\">20<\/sup><\/a> He was reminding them that He was the Savior of the world and that He was sent by the Father to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of God\u2019s children. Surely the Son of God would not perish on a boat. He exemplified divine poise because He knew of His divinity and He knew that there was a plan of salvation and exaltation and how essential His Atonement would be to the eternal success of that plan.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445197\" id=\"p20\">It is through Christ and His Atonement that all good things come into our lives. As we remember who we are, knowing that there is a divine plan of mercy and drawing courage in the strength of the Lord, we can do all things. We will find calm. We will be good women and men in any storm.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445207\" id=\"p21\">May we seek the blessings of Christlike poise, not only to help ourselves in challenging times but to bless others and help them through the storms in their lives. On this eve of Palm Sunday, I joyfully testify of Jesus Christ. He is risen. I testify of the peace, calm, and heavenly poise that only He brings to our lives and do so in His holy name, Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<\/div>\n<footer class=\"notes\">\n<p class=\"title\" data-aid=\"154445218\" id=\"note_title1\">Notes<\/p>\n<ol class=\"decimal\" data-type=\"marker\" start=\"1\">\n<li data-marker=\"1.\" id=\"note1\" data-full-marker=\"1.\">\n<p data-aid=\"154445229\" id=\"note1_p1\">Hugh B.
