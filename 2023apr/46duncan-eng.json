Duncan<\/p>\n<p class=\"author-role\" data-aid=\"154445142\" id=\"author2\">Of the Seventy<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"kicker\" data-aid=\"154445150\" id=\"kicker1\">The building of temples has been one of the highest priorities of all prophets since the Prophet Joseph Smith.<\/p>\n<\/header>\n<div class=\"body-block\">\n<p data-aid=\"154445160\" id=\"p1\">\u201cNow, what do we hear in the gospel which we have received? A voice of gladness! A voice of mercy from heaven; and a voice of truth out of the earth; \u2026 a voice of gladness for the living and the dead; glad tidings of great joy.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\">1<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445168\" id=\"p2\">Brothers and sisters, it is almost impossible to hear these words from the Prophet Joseph Smith and not break out into a great big smile!<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445178\" id=\"p3\">Joseph\u2019s jubilant expression truly captures the full and majestic joy found in God our Heavenly Father\u2019s great plan of happiness, for He has assured us, \u201cMen are, that they might have joy.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\">2<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445188\" id=\"p4\">We all shouted for joy<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\">3<\/sup><\/a> in our premortal life when we heard God\u2019s plan of happiness, and we continue to shout for joy here as we live according to His plan. But what exactly was the context for this happy declaration from the Prophet? What spurred these deep and heartfelt emotions?<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445198\" id=\"p5\">The Prophet Joseph had been teaching about baptism for the dead. This was indeed a glorious revelation that was received with great joy. When Church members first learned that they could be baptized for their deceased loved ones, they rejoiced. Wilford Woodruff said, \u201cThe moment I heard of it, my soul leaped [for] joy!\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\">4<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445208\" id=\"p6\">Baptism for our deceased loved ones wasn\u2019t the only truth the Lord would reveal and restore. There were a host of other gifts, or endowments, that God had been eager to bestow upon His sons and daughters.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445219\" id=\"p7\">These other gifts included priesthood authority, covenants and ordinances, marriages that could last forever, the sealing of children to their parents within the family of God, and ultimately the blessing of returning home to the presence of God, our Heavenly Father, and His Son, Jesus Christ. All these blessings were made possible through the Atonement of Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445230\" id=\"p8\">Because God considered these to be among His highest and holiest blessings,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\">5<\/sup><\/a> He instructed that sacred buildings be erected where He could confer these precious gifts upon His children.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\">6<\/sup><\/a> These buildings would be His home on earth. These buildings would be temples where that which was sealed or bound on earth in His name, by His word, and with His authority would be bound in the heavens.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\">7<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445241\" id=\"p9\">As members of the Church today, some of us may find it easy to take these glorious eternal truths for granted. They have become second nature to us. Sometimes it is helpful when we see them through the eyes of those who learn about them for the very first time. This became evident to me through a recent experience.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445252\" id=\"p10\">Last year, just prior to the rededication of the Tokyo Japan Temple, many guests not of our faith toured that temple. One such tour included a thoughtful leader from another religion. We taught our guest about Heavenly Father\u2019s plan of happiness, Jesus Christ\u2019s redeeming role in that plan, and the doctrine that families can be united eternally through the sealing ordinance.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445263\" id=\"p11\">At the conclusion of the tour, I invited our friend to share his feelings. In reference to the uniting of families\u2014past, present, and future\u2014this good man asked in all sincerity, \u201cDo the members of your faith truly understand just how profound this doctrine is?\u201d He added, \u201cThis may well be one of the only teachings that can unite this world that is so divided.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445270\" id=\"p13\">What a powerful observation. This man was not moved simply by the exquisite craftsmanship of the temple but rather by the stunning and profound doctrine that families are united and sealed to Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ forever.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\">8<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445281\" id=\"p14\">We should not be surprised, then, when even someone not of our faith recognizes the majesty of what happens in the temple. What could become common or routine for us is sometimes seen in its splendor and majesty by those who hear it or feel it for the very first time.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445284\" id=\"p15\">Although temples had existed anciently, with the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the building of temples has been one of the highest priorities of all prophets since the Prophet Joseph Smith. And it is easy to understand why.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445294\" id=\"p16\">When the Prophet Joseph was teaching about baptism for the dead, he revealed another great truth. He taught: \u201cLet me assure you that these are principles in relation to the dead and the living that cannot be lightly passed over, as pertaining to our salvation. For their salvation is necessary and essential to our salvation, \u2026 they without us cannot be made perfect\u2014neither can we without our dead be made perfect.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\">9<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445304\" id=\"p18\">As we can see, the need for temples and the work that is done for both the living and the dead become very clear. <\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445315\" id=\"p38\">The adversary is on the alert. His power is threatened by the ordinances and covenants performed in temples, and he does anything he can to try to stop the work. Why? Because he knows of the power that comes from this sacred work. As each new temple is dedicated, the saving power of Jesus Christ expands throughout the world to counteract the efforts of the adversary and to redeem us as we come unto Him. As temples and covenant keepers grow in number, the adversary grows weaker.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445326\" id=\"p19\">In the early days of the Church, some would worry when a new temple would be announced, for they would say, \u201cWe never began to build a temple without the bells of hell starting to ring.\u201d But Brigham Young courageously retorted, \u201cI want to hear them ring again.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\">10<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445337\" id=\"p20\">In this mortal life, we will never escape the war, but we can have power over the enemy. That power and strength come from Jesus Christ as we make and keep temple covenants.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445348\" id=\"p21\">President RussellÂ M. Nelson has taught: \u201cThe time is coming when those who do not obey the Lord will be separated from those who do. Our safest insurance is to continue to be worthy of admission to His holy house.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\">11<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445359\" id=\"p22\">Here are some additional blessings God has promised us through His prophet:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445373\" id=\"p23\">Do you need miracles? Our prophet has said: \u201cI promise you that the Lord will bring the miracles He knows you need as you make sacrifices to serve and worship in His temples.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\">12<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445384\" id=\"p29\">Do you need the healing and strengthening power of the Savior Jesus Christ? President Nelson reassures us that \u201ceverything taught in the temple \u2026 increases our understanding of Jesus Christ. \u2026 As we keep our covenants, He endows us with <em>His<\/em> healing, strengthening power. And oh, how we will need His power in the days ahead.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\">13<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445395\" id=\"p31\">On the first Palm Sunday, as Jesus Christ triumphantly entered Jerusalem, a multitude of His disciples \u201crejoice[d] and praise[d] God with a loud voice \u2026 saying, Blessed be the King that cometh in the name of the Lord.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note14\"><sup class=\"marker\">14<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445406\" id=\"p32\">How fitting that on Palm Sunday of 1836, the Kirtland Temple was being dedicated. On that occasion the disciples of Jesus Christ were rejoicing as well. In that dedicatory prayer, the Prophet Joseph Smith declared these words of praise:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445417\" id=\"p33\">\u201cO Lord God Almighty, hear us \u2026 and answer us from heaven, \u2026 where thou sittest enthroned, with glory, honor, power, majesty, [and] might.Â \u2026<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445428\" id=\"p34\">\u201c\u2026 Help us by the power of thy Spirit, that we may mingle our voices with those bright, shining seraphs around thy throne, with acclamations of praise, singing Hosanna to God and the Lamb!<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445439\" id=\"p37\">\u201cAnd let these \u2026 thy saints shout aloud for joy.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note15\"><sup class=\"marker\">15<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445449\" id=\"p35\">Brothers and sisters, today on this Palm Sunday, let us as disciples of Jesus Christ also praise our holy God and rejoice in His goodness to us. \u201cWhat do we hear in the gospel which we have received?\u201d Truly \u201ca voice of gladness!\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note16\"><sup class=\"marker\">16<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445459\" id=\"p36\">I witness that you will feel joy more and more as you enter the holy temples of the Lord.
