They were innovative in getting him there\u2014uncovering the roof and lowering the man, on his bed, to the place where Jesus was teaching. When Jesus \u201csaw their faith, he said [to the man with palsy], thy sins are forgiven thee.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\">1<\/sup><\/a> And then, \u201cArise, and take up thy bed, and go thy way into thine house.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\">2<\/sup><\/a> And immediately the man with palsy arose and took his bed and departed for home, \u201cglorifying God.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\">3<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445120\" id=\"p2\">What more do we know of the friends who provided care for the man with palsy? We know that the Savior recognized <em>their<\/em> faith. And having seen and heard the Savior and being a witness to His miracles, they were \u201camazed\u201d and \u201cglorified God.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\">4<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445128\" id=\"p3\">Jesus Christ had provided the hoped-for healing\u2014physical <em>relief<\/em> from pain and the crippling consequences of chronic disease. Significantly, the Savior also provided spiritual <em>relief<\/em> in cleansing the man from sin.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445137\" id=\"p4\">And the friends\u2014in their efforts to care for one in need, they found the source of relief; they found Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445146\" id=\"p5\">I testify that Jesus Christ <em>is<\/em> relief. Through the Atonement of Jesus Christ, we may be relieved of the burden and consequences of sin and be succored in our infirmities.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445156\" id=\"p6\">And because we love God and have covenanted to serve Him, we can partner with the Savior to help provide temporal and spiritual relief for those in need\u2014and in the process find our own relief in Jesus Christ.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\">5<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445163\" id=\"p7\">Our beloved prophet, President Russell M. Nelson, invited us to overcome the world and find rest.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\">6<\/sup><\/a> He defined \u201ctrue rest\u201d as \u201crelief and peace.\u201d President Nelson said, \u201cBecause the Savior, through His infinite Atonement, redeemed each of us from weakness, mistakes, and sin, and because He experienced every pain, worry, and burden you have ever had, then as you truly repent and seek His help, you can rise above this present precarious world.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\">7<\/sup><\/a> That is the relief Jesus Christ offers us!<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445172\" id=\"p8\">Each of us is carrying a metaphorical backpack. It may be a basket balanced on your head or a satchel or a bundle of things wrapped in cloth and thrown over your shoulder. But for our thinking, let\u2019s call it a backpack.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445182\" id=\"p9\">This metaphorical backpack is where we carry the burdens of living in a fallen world. Our burdens are like rocks in the backpack. Generally, there are three kinds:<\/p>\n<ul class=\"bullet\">\n<li>\n<p data-aid=\"154445191\" id=\"p10\">Rocks there of our own doing because of sin.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p data-aid=\"154445201\" id=\"p11\">Rocks in our backpack because of the poor decisions, misconduct, and unkindness of others.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p data-aid=\"154445211\" id=\"p12\">And rocks we carry because we are living in a fallen condition. These include the rocks of disease, pain, chronic illness, grief, disappointment, loneliness, and the effects of natural disasters.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p data-aid=\"154445222\" id=\"p13\">I joyfully declare that our mortal burdens, these rocks in our figurative backpack, need not feel heavy.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445233\" id=\"p14\">Jesus Christ can lighten our load.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445245\" id=\"p15\">Jesus Christ can lift our burdens.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445255\" id=\"p16\">Jesus Christ provides a way for us to be relieved of the weight of sin.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445269\" id=\"p17\">Jesus Christ is our relief.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445292\" id=\"p18\">He said:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445301\" id=\"p19\">\u201cCome unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest [that is, relief and peace].<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445313\" id=\"p20\">\u201cTake my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445324\" id=\"p21\">\u201cFor my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\">8<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445335\" id=\"p22\">That the yoke is easy and the burden is light presumes we get in the yoke with the Savior, that we share our burdens with Him, that we let Him lift our load. That means entering into a covenant relationship with God and keeping that covenant, which, as President Nelson has explained, \u201cmakes <em>everything<\/em> about life easier.\u201d He said, \u201cYoking yourself with the Savior means you have access to <em>His<\/em> strength and redeeming power.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\">9<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445345\" id=\"p23\">So why are we stingy with our rocks? Why would a weary baseball pitcher refuse to leave the mound when a reliever is there ready to complete the game?

Oaks, \u201c<a class=\"cross-ref\" href=\"/study/general-conference/2014/04/the-keys-and-authority-of-the-priesthood?lang=eng&amp;para=14#p14\">The Keys and Authority of the Priesthood<\/a>,\u201d <cite>Ensign<\/cite> or <cite>Liahona<\/cite>, May 2014, 51). In selecting a name for the new organization, the word <i>benevolent<\/i> was considered, but <i>relief<\/i> was favored by the women. Emma Smith, the organization\u2019s first president, and Eliza R. Snow, its secretary who later served as the second president of the Relief Society, explained that <i>benevolent<\/i> was a popular word\u2014popular with the institutions of the day\u2014but that popular \u201cshould not be our guide.\u201d Emma expounded that the word <i>relief<\/i> better described their mission. \u201cWe are going to do something extraordinary \u2026 we expect extraordinary occasions and pressing calls\u201d (Emma Smith, in Nauvoo Relief Society Minute Book, Mar. 17, 1842, 12, josephsmithpapers.org). Indeed, the mandate of Relief Society has always been to provide temporal and spiritual relief. Joseph Smith taught, \u201cThe Society is not only to relieve the poor, but to save souls\u201d (in Nauvoo Relief Society Minute Book, June 9, 1842, 63, josephsmithpapers.org). And so the Relief Society continues to provide relief: \u201cRelief of poverty, relief of illness; relief of doubt, relief of ignorance\u2014relief of all that hinders the joy and progress of woman\u201d (John A. Widtsoe, <cite>Evidences and Reconciliations<\/cite>, arr. G. Homer Durham, 3 vols. in 1 [1960], 308).<\/p>",
