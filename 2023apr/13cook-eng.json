Cook<\/p>\n<p class=\"author-role\" data-aid=\"154443621\" id=\"author2\">Of the Presidency of the Seventy<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"kicker\" data-aid=\"154443624\" id=\"kicker1\">Exercising faith in our Savior, Jesus Christ, helps us overcome discouragement no matter what obstacles we encounter.<\/p>\n<\/header>\n<div class=\"body-block\">\n<p data-aid=\"154443628\" id=\"p1\">Elder George A. Smith, an Apostle, received counsel from the Prophet Joseph Smith at a time of great difficulty: \u201cHe told me I should never get discouraged, whatever difficulties might surround me. If I was sunk in the lowest pit of Nova Scotia and all the Rocky Mountains piled on top of me, I ought not to be discouraged but hang on, exercise faith, and keep up good courage and I should come out on the top of the heap at last.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\">1<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154443632\" id=\"p2\">How could the Prophet Joseph say that\u2014to someone who was suffering? Because he knew it was true. He lived it. Joseph repeatedly experienced severe difficulties in his life. However, as he exercised faith in Jesus Christ and His Atonement and just kept going, he overcame seemingly insurmountable obstacles.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\">2<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154443636\" id=\"p3\">Today I would like to renew Joseph\u2019s plea not to let discouragement overwhelm us when we face disappointment, painful experiences, our own inadequacies, or other challenges.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154443640\" id=\"p4\">When I say discouragement, I\u2019m not talking about the more debilitating challenges of clinical depression, anxiety disorders, or other illnesses that require special treatment.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\">3<\/sup><\/a> I\u2019m just talking about plain old discouragement that comes with the ups and downs of life.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154443644\" id=\"p5\">I am inspired by my heroes who just keep going\u2014with faith\u2014no matter what.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\">4<\/sup><\/a> In the Book of Mormon, we read of Zoram, the servant of Laban. When Nephi obtained the brass plates, Zoram was faced with the choice to follow Nephi and his brothers into the wilderness or possibly lose his life.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154443648\" id=\"p6\">What a choice! Zoram\u2019s first inclination was to run, but Nephi held him and made an oath that if he would go with them, he would be free and have a place with their family. Zoram took courage and went with them.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\">5<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154443652\" id=\"p7\">Zoram suffered many afflictions in his new life, yet he pressed forward with faith. We have no indication that Zoram clung to his past or harbored resentment toward God or others.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\">6<\/sup><\/a> He was a true friend to Nephi, a prophet, and he and his seed dwelt in freedom and prosperity in the promised land. What had been a huge obstacle in Zoram\u2019s path eventually led to rich blessings, due to his faithfulness and willingness to just keep going\u2014with faith.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\">7<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154443656\" id=\"p8\">Recently I listened to a courageous sister share how she persevered through difficulties.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\">8<\/sup><\/a> She had some challenges, and one Sunday she was sitting in Relief Society, listening to a teacher who she thought lived a picture-perfect life\u2014totally different from her own. She was tired and discouraged. She felt like she didn\u2019t measure up\u2014or even belong\u2014so she got up and left, planning to never return to church again. Walking to her car, she felt a distinct impression: \u201cGo into the chapel and listen to the sacrament meeting speaker.\u201d She questioned the prompting but felt it again strongly, so she went into the meeting.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154443660\" id=\"p9\">The message was exactly what she needed. She felt the Spirit. She knew the Lord wanted her to stay with Him, to be His disciple, and to attend church, so she did.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154443665\" id=\"p10\">Do you know what she was grateful for? That she didn\u2019t give up. She just kept going\u2014with faith in Jesus Christ, even when it stretched her, and she and her family are being abundantly blessed as she presses forward.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154443671\" id=\"p11\">The God of heaven and earth will help us overcome discouragement and whatever obstacles we encounter if we look to Him, follow the promptings of the Holy Ghost,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\">9<\/sup><\/a> and just keep going\u2014with faith.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154443676\" id=\"p12\">Thankfully, when we are weak or incapable, the Lord can strengthen our faith. He can increase our capacity beyond our own. I have experienced that. More than 20 years ago, I was unexpectedly called as an Area Seventy, and I felt very inadequate. Following my training assignments, I was to preside at my first stake conference.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\">10<\/sup><\/a> The stake president and I meticulously planned every detail. Shortly before the conference, President Boyd K. Packer, then\u2013Acting President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, called to see if he could accompany me. I was surprised and, of course, agreed. I asked how he would like to proceed since he would preside. He suggested that we undo the plans and prepare to follow the Spirit. Thankfully, I still had 10 days to study, pray, and prepare.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154443681\" id=\"p13\">With an open agenda, we were on the stand 20 minutes before the leadership meeting began. I leaned over to the stake president and whispered, \u201cThis is a wonderful stake.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154443686\" id=\"p14\">President Packer elbowed me gently and said, \u201cNo talking.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154443691\" id=\"p15\">I stopped talking, and his general conference talk \u201cReverence Invites Revelation\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\">11<\/sup><\/a> came to mind. I observed that President Packer was writing down scripture references. The Spirit confirmed to me that he was receiving impressions for the meeting. My learning experience had just begun.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154443696\" id=\"p16\">President Packer spoke for the first 15 minutes and emphasized the importance of conducting all meetings as guided by the Holy Spirit.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\">12<\/sup><\/a> He then said, \u201cWe will now hear from Elder Cook.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154443701\" id=\"p17\">On my way to the pulpit, I asked how long he would like me to take and if there was a topic he would like me to address. He said, \u201cTake 15 minutes and carry on as you feel inspired.\u201d I took about 14 minutes and shared everything I had on my mind.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154443706\" id=\"p18\">President Packer stood again and spoke for another 15 minutes. He shared this scripture:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154443711\" id=\"p19\">\u201cSpeak the thoughts that I shall put into your hearts, and you shall not be confounded before men;<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154443716\" id=\"p20\">\u201cFor it shall be given you \u2026 in the very moment, what ye shall say.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\">13<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154443721\" id=\"p21\">Then he said, \u201cWe will now hear from Elder Cook.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154443726\" id=\"p22\">I was shocked. I had never considered the possibility that I would be asked to speak twice in one meeting. I didn\u2019t have anything in mind to say. Praying fervently and relying on the Lord for help, somehow, I was blessed with a thought, a scripture, and I was able to speak for another 15 minutes. I sat down totally exhausted.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154443731\" id=\"p23\">President Packer spoke again for 15 minutes about following the Spirit and shared Paul\u2019s teachings that we should not speak \u201cwords which man\u2019s wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note14\"><sup class=\"marker\">14<\/sup><\/a> As you can imagine, I was overwhelmed when he was impressed to say for the third time, \u201cWe will now hear from Elder Cook.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154443736\" id=\"p24\">I was empty. I had nothing. I knew it was time to exercise more faith. Slowly, I made my way to the pulpit, pleading to God for help. As I stepped up to the microphone, the Lord miraculously blessed me to somehow give another 15-minute message.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note15\"><sup class=\"marker\">15<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154443741\" id=\"p25\">The meeting finally ended, but I quickly realized that the adult session would start in one hour. Oh, no! Like Zoram, I sincerely wanted to run, but just as Nephi caught him, I knew President Packer would catch me. The adult meeting followed the very same pattern. I spoke three more times. The next day during the general session, I spoke once.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154443747\" id=\"p26\">After the conference, President Packer said with affection, \u201cLet\u2019s do it again sometime.\u201d I love President Boyd K. Packer and appreciate all that I learned.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154443752\" id=\"p27\">Do you know what I am grateful for? That I didn\u2019t give up\u2014or resist. If I had given in to my desperate desire to escape from those meetings, I would have missed an opportunity to increase my faith and receive a rich outpouring of love and support from my Heavenly Father.
