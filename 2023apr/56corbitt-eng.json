The woman I happened to sit next to noticed what I was writing on my computer and asked, \u201cYou believe in \u2026 Christ?\u201d I said, \u201cYes, I do!\u201d As we talked, I learned she had just moved to the area from her beautiful Asian country to work in New York\u2019s highly competitive information technology sector.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444815\" id=\"p6\">Naturally, I asked her, \u201cDo you know why I as a Christian believe in Jesus Christ?\u201d She too responded normally and invited me to tell her. But as I went to speak, I had one of those moments where many thoughts flood your mind. This was the first time I would explain the \u201cwhy\u201d of Christianity to someone very unfamiliar with it and highly intelligent. I couldn\u2019t simply say, \u201cI follow Jesus Christ because He willingly suffered and died for my sins.\u201d She might wonder, \u201cDid Jesus have to die? Couldn\u2019t God simply forgive and cleanse us of our sins if we asked Him to?\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444819\" id=\"p7\">How would you have responded in a few minutes? How would you explain this to a friend? Children and youth: would you please ask your parents or a leader later on, \u201cWhy did Jesus have to die?\u201d And, brothers and sisters, I have a confession to make: despite all I thought I knew about Church doctrine, history, policy, and so on, the answer to this central question to our faith did not come so easily. That day I decided to focus more on what matters most to eternal life.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444823\" id=\"p2\">Well, I informed my new friend<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\">1<\/sup><\/a> that we have a spirit in addition to a body and that God is the Father of our spirits.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\">2<\/sup><\/a> I told her we lived with our Heavenly Father before our births into this mortal world.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\">3<\/sup><\/a> Because He loves her and all His children, He made a plan for us to receive a body in the image of His glorified body,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\">4<\/sup><\/a> be part of a family,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\">5<\/sup><\/a> and return to His loving presence to enjoy eternal life with our families<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\">6<\/sup><\/a> like He does with His.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\">7<\/sup><\/a> But, I said, we would face two main obstacles in this necessarily fallen world:<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\">8<\/sup><\/a> (1) physical death\u2014the separation of our bodies from our spirits. Of course, she knew we would all die. And (2) spiritual death\u2014our separation from God because our sins, mistakes, and flaws as mortals distance us from His holy presence.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\">9<\/sup><\/a> She related to this too.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444829\" id=\"p8\">I informed her that this was an effect of the law of justice. This <em>eternal law<\/em> demands that an <em>eternal penalty<\/em> be paid for every one of our sins, or violations of God\u2019s laws or truth, or we could <em>never<\/em> return to live in His holy presence.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\">10<\/sup><\/a> It would be unjust, and God \u201ccannot deny justice.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\">11<\/sup><\/a> She understood this but easily grasped that God is also merciful, loving, and eager to bring to pass our eternal life.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\">12<\/sup><\/a> I informed my friend that we would also have a cunning, powerful adversary\u2014the source of evil and lies\u2014opposing us.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\">13<\/sup><\/a> Therefore, someone with <em>infinite<\/em> godly power to overcome all such opposition and obstacles would need to save us.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note14\"><sup class=\"marker\">14<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444832\" id=\"p9\">I then shared with her the good news\u2014the \u201cgood tidings of great joy \u2026 to all people\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note15\"><sup class=\"marker\">15<\/sup><\/a>\u2014that \u201cGod so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note16\"><sup class=\"marker\">16<\/sup><\/a> I testified to my friend, and I witness to you, that Jesus Christ is that Savior, that He <em>had<\/em> to suffer, die, and rise again\u2014His <em>infinite<\/em> Atonement\u2014to redeem all humanity from physical death<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note17\"><sup class=\"marker\">17<\/sup><\/a> and to give eternal life with God and our families<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note18\"><sup class=\"marker\">18<\/sup><\/a> to <em>all<\/em> who would follow Him. The Book of Mormon declares, \u201cThus God \u2026 gained the victory over death; giving the Son power to make intercession for the children of men \u2026 ; being filled with [mercy and] compassion \u2026 ; having broken the bands of death, taken upon himself their iniquity and their transgressions, having redeemed them, and satisfied the demands of justice.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note19\"><sup class=\"marker\">19<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444836\" id=\"p4\">The steps God revealed we must take to follow Jesus and receive eternal life are called the doctrine of Christ. They include \u201cfaith in Jesus Christ and His Atonement, repentance, baptism [into The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints], receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note20\"><sup class=\"marker\">20<\/sup><\/a> I shared these steps with my friend, but here are some ways in which prophets and apostles have recently taught how the doctrine of Christ can bless all God\u2019s children.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444841\" id=\"p10\">President Russell M. Nelson instructed: \u201cThe pure doctrine of Christ is powerful. It changes the life of <em>everyone<\/em> who understands it and seeks to implement it in his or her life.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note21\"><sup class=\"marker\">21<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444845\" id=\"p14\">Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf taught, \u201c[The] <em>For the Strength of Youth<\/em> [guide] is bold in declaring the doctrine of \u2026 Christ [and] inviting you [<em>youth<\/em>] to make choices based on [it].\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note22\"><sup class=\"marker\">22<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444848\" id=\"p15\">Elder Dale G. Renlund taught, \u201cWe invite <em>missionaries<\/em> to do what they ask those they teach to do: \u2026 apply the doctrine of Christ in their lives [and] get on and stay on the covenant path.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note23\"><sup class=\"marker\">23<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444852\" id=\"p16\">The doctrine of Christ empowers those who are <em>struggling or feel they don\u2019t belong in the Church<\/em> because it helps them, as Elder D. Todd Christofferson stated, \u201caffirm: Jesus Christ died for me \u2026 [and] loves me.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note24\"><sup class=\"marker\">24<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444856\" id=\"p11\"><em>Parents<\/em>, if your child struggles with a gospel principle or prophetic teaching, <em>please<\/em> resist any type of evil speaking<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note25\"><sup class=\"marker\">25<\/sup><\/a> or activism toward the Church or its leaders. These lesser, secular approaches are beneath you and can be lethal to the long-term faithfulness of your child.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note26\"><sup class=\"marker\">26<\/sup><\/a> It speaks so well of you that you would protect or advocate for your precious child or show signs of solidarity with him or her. But my wife, Jayne, and I know from personal experience that teaching your beloved child why we all desperately need Jesus Christ and how to apply His joyful doctrine is what will <em>strengthen and heal him or her<\/em>. Let us turn them to Jesus, who is their true advocate <em>with the Father<\/em>. The Apostle John taught, \u201cWhosoever \u2026 abideth in the doctrine of Christ \u2026 hath both the Father and the Son.\u201d He then warns us to beware \u201cif there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note27\"><sup class=\"marker\">27<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444860\" id=\"p12\">Jayne and I recently visited the wilderness where Moses held up a serpent of brass before the wandering children of Israel. The Lord had promised to heal all who were bitten by poisonous snakes if they would simply look upon it.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note28\"><sup class=\"marker\">28<\/sup><\/a> In holding up the doctrine of Christ before us, the Lord\u2019s prophet is doing the same, \u201cthat he should heal the nations.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note29\"><sup class=\"marker\">29<\/sup><\/a> Whatever the bites or poison or struggles we experience in this mortal wilderness, let us not be as those who, anciently and presently, could have been healed but, sadly, \u201cwould not look \u2026 because they did not believe that it would heal them.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note30\"><sup class=\"marker\">30<\/sup><\/a> The Book of Mormon affirms: \u201cBehold, \u2026 this is the way; and there is none other way nor name given under heaven whereby man can be saved in the kingdom of God.

Additionally, the promise of eternal life is not just to those who are married in this life. President M. Russell Ballard taught, \u201cScriptures and latter-day prophets confirm that <em>everyone<\/em> who is faithful in keeping gospel covenants will have the opportunity for exaltation\u201d (\u201c<a class=\"cross-ref\" href=\"/study/general-conference/2021/04/28ballard?lang=eng&amp;para=23#p23\">Hope in Christ<\/a>,\u201d <cite>Liahona<\/cite>, May 2021, 55; emphasis added).

Already-deceased family members in the spirit world who were not able to embrace the doctrine of Christ in this life can do so in the spirit world as ordinances like baptism, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and others that help us endure to the end are lovingly performed vicariously by living relatives in temples of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Additionally, the promise of eternal life is not just to those who are married in this life. President M. Russell Ballard taught, \u201cScriptures and latter-day prophets confirm that <em>everyone<\/em> who is faithful in keeping gospel covenants will have the opportunity for exaltation\u201d (\u201c<a class=\"cross-ref\" href=\"/study/general-conference/2021/04/28ballard?lang=eng&amp;para=23#p23\">Hope in Christ<\/a>,\u201d <cite>Liahona<\/cite>, May 2021, 55; emphasis added). Citing President Russell M. Nelson and President Dallin H. Oaks, President Ballard continued, \u201cThe precise time and manner in which the blessings of exaltation are bestowed have not all been revealed, but they are nonetheless <em>assured<\/em>\u201d (\u201c<a class=\"cross-ref\" href=\"/study/general-conference/2021/04/28ballard?lang=eng&amp;para=24#p24\">Hope in Christ<\/a>,\u201d 55; emphasis added). President Nelson taught: \u201cIn the Lord\u2019s own way and time, no [blessing] will be withheld from His faithful Saints. The Lord will judge and reward each individual according to heartfelt desire as well as deed\u201d (\u201c<a class=\"cross-ref\" href=\"/study/general-conference/2008/10/celestial-marriage?lang=eng&amp;para=23#p23\">Celestial Marriage<\/a>,\u201d <cite>Ensign<\/cite> or <cite>Liahona<\/cite>, Nov. 2008, 94). And President Oaks explained, \u201cMany of the most important deprivations of mortality will be set right in the Millennium, which is the time for fulfilling all that is incomplete in the great plan of happiness for all of our Father\u2019s worthy children\u201d (\u201c<a class=\"cross-ref\" href=\"/study/general-conference/1993/10/the-great-plan-of-happiness?lang=eng&amp;para=40#p40\">The Great Plan of Happiness<\/a>,\u201d <cite>Ensign<\/cite>, Nov. 1993, 75).
