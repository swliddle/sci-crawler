It was the most important week in human history.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445239\" id=\"p2\">What began with the heralding of Jesus as the promised Messiah in His triumphant entry into Jerusalem closed with His Crucifixion and Resurrection.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\">1<\/sup><\/a> By divine design, His atoning sacrifice concluded His mortal ministry, making it possible for us to live with our Heavenly Father for eternity.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445250\" id=\"p3\">Scriptures tell us that the week began with throngs standing at the gates of the city to see \u201cJesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\">2<\/sup><\/a> They \u201ctook branches of palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried: Hosanna: Blessed is the King of Israel that cometh in the name of the Lord.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\">3<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445261\" id=\"p4\">That biblical account of so long ago reminds me of being on a Church assignment in Takoradi, Ghana.

As I was speaking from the pulpit, I noticed out the window they were joyfully walking down the street waving palms in their hands, much like those in this photo. It was a sight I will never forget\u2014all of us that day worshipping the King of kings.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445310\" id=\"p9\">President Russell M. Nelson has admonished us to make Palm Sunday \u201ctruly holy by remembering, not just the palms that were waved to honor the entrance of Jesus into Jerusalem, but by remembering the palms of His hands.\u201d Then President Nelson referred to Isaiah, who spoke of the Savior\u2019s promising, \u201cI will never forget you,\u201d with these words: \u201cBehold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\">8<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445321\" id=\"p10\">The Lord knows firsthand that mortality is hard. His wounds remind us that He \u201cdescended below \u2026 all\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\">9<\/sup><\/a> that He might succor us when we suffer and be our example to \u201chold on thy way,\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\">10<\/sup><\/a> His way, that \u201cGod shall be with [us] forever and ever.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\">11<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445332\" id=\"p11\">Palm Sunday was not just an event, another page in history with a date, time, and place. Jesus Christ\u2019s triumphant entry into Jerusalem and the events of the week that followed exemplify doctrine we can apply in our lives today.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445343\" id=\"p12\">Let us look at some of the eternal doctrine that weaves through His ministry concluding in Jerusalem.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445354\" id=\"p13\">First, prophecy. For example, Old Testament prophet Zechariah prophesied of Jesus Christ\u2019s triumphal entry into Jerusalem, even describing He would ride on a donkey.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\">12<\/sup><\/a> Jesus foretold His Resurrection as He prepared to enter the city, saying:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445368\" id=\"p14\">\u201cBehold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes, and they shall condemn him to death,<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445379\" id=\"p15\">\u201cAnd shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify him: and the third day he shall rise again.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\">13<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445390\" id=\"p16\">Second, the companionship of the Holy Ghost. Joseph Smith taught, \u201cNo man can know that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note14\"><sup class=\"marker\">14<\/sup><\/a> The Savior promised His disciples<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note15\"><sup class=\"marker\">15<\/sup><\/a> at the Last Supper<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note16\"><sup class=\"marker\">16<\/sup><\/a> in the upper room,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note17\"><sup class=\"marker\">17<\/sup><\/a> \u201cI will not leave you comfortless.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note18\"><sup class=\"marker\">18<\/sup><\/a> They would not be alone to carry the truths of the gospel forward but would have the consummate gift of the Holy Ghost to guide them. \u201cPeace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you,\u201d He promised; \u201cnot as the world giveth, give I unto you.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note19\"><sup class=\"marker\">19<\/sup><\/a> With the gift of the Holy Ghost, we have that same assurance\u2014that we \u201cmay always have his Spirit to be with [us]\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note20\"><sup class=\"marker\">20<\/sup><\/a> and \u201cby the power of the Holy Ghost [we] may know the truth of all things.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note21\"><sup class=\"marker\">21<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445401\" id=\"p17\">Third, discipleship. True discipleship is unfailing commitment, obedience to eternal laws, and love of God, first and foremost. Nothing wavering. The multitude who paid tribute with palms hailed Him as the Messiah. That was exactly who He was. They were drawn to Him, His miracles, and His teachings. But the adulation for many did not last. Some who earlier had shouted, \u201cHosanna,\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note22\"><sup class=\"marker\">22<\/sup><\/a> soon turned and cried, \u201cCrucify him.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note23\"><sup class=\"marker\">23<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445412\" id=\"p18\">Fourth, the Atonement of Jesus Christ.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note24\"><sup class=\"marker\">24<\/sup><\/a> In His final days, following Palm Sunday, He carried out His remarkable Atonement, from the agony of Gethsemane to the mockery of His trial, His torture on the cross, and His burial in a borrowed tomb. But it did not stop there. With the majesty of His calling as the Redeemer of all of Heavenly Father\u2019s children, three days later He stepped forth from that tomb, resurrected,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note25\"><sup class=\"marker\">25<\/sup><\/a> as He had prophesied.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445424\" id=\"p19\">Are we continually grateful for the incomparable Atonement of Jesus Christ? Do we feel its purifying power, right now? That is why Jesus Christ, the Author and Finisher of our salvation, went to Jerusalem, to save us all. Do these words in Alma strike a chord: \u201cIf ye have experienced a change of heart, and if ye have felt to sing the song of redeeming love, I would ask, can ye feel so now?\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note26\"><sup class=\"marker\">26<\/sup><\/a> I can truly say, the choir in Takoradi that Palm Sunday sang \u201cthe song of redeeming love.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445436\" id=\"p20\">That last fateful week of His mortal ministry, Jesus Christ gave the parable of the ten virgins.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note27\"><sup class=\"marker\">27<\/sup><\/a> He was teaching of His return to those prepared to receive Him, not with palms in their hands but with the light of the gospel within them. He used the image of lamps lit and burning, with extra oil to fuel the flame, as a description of a willingness to live His ways, embrace His truths, and share His light.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445447\" id=\"p21\">You know the story. The ten virgins represent members of the Church, and the bridegroom represents Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445457\" id=\"p22\">The ten virgins took their lamps and \u201cwent forth to meet the bridegroom.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note28\"><sup class=\"marker\">28<\/sup><\/a> Five were wise, prepared with oil in their lamps and some to spare, and five were foolish, lamps dark with no oil in reserve. When the call came, \u201cBehold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him,\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note29\"><sup class=\"marker\">29<\/sup><\/a> the five who were \u201cwise and [had] received the truth, and [had] taken the Holy Spirit for their guide\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note30\"><sup class=\"marker\">30<\/sup><\/a> were ready for \u201ctheir king and their lawgiver,\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note31\"><sup class=\"marker\">31<\/sup><\/a> that \u201chis glory [would] be upon them.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note32\"><sup class=\"marker\">32<\/sup><\/a> The other five were frantically trying to find oil. But it was too late. The procession went forward without them. When they knocked and pleaded for entrance, the Lord responded, \u201cI know you not.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note33\"><sup class=\"marker\">33<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445467\" id=\"p23\">How would we feel if He said to us, \u201cI know you not!\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445477\" id=\"p24\">We, like the ten virgins, have lamps; but do we have oil? I fear there are some who are just getting by on a thin skiff of oil, too busy with worldly pressures to properly prepare. Oil comes from believing and acting on prophecy and the words of living prophets, President Nelson in particular, his counselors, and the Twelve Apostles. Oil fills our souls when we hear and feel the Holy Ghost and act on that divine guidance. Oil pours into our hearts when our choices show we love the Lord and we love what He loves. Oil comes from repenting and seeking the healing of the Atonement of Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445487\" id=\"p25\">If some of you are looking to fill what some call \u201ca bucket list,\u201d this is it: fill your bucket with oil in the form of the living water of Jesus Christ,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note34\"><sup class=\"marker\">34<\/sup><\/a> which is a representation of His life and teachings. In contrast, checking off a far-off place or a spectacular event will never leave your soul feeling whole or satisfied; living the doctrine taught by Jesus Christ will. I mentioned examples earlier: embrace prophecy and prophetic teachings, act on promptings of the Holy Ghost, become a true disciple, and seek the healing power of our Lord\u2019s Atonement. That bucket list will take you somewhere you want to go\u2014back to your Father in Heaven.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445497\" id=\"p26\">That Palm Sunday in Takoradi was a very special experience for me because I shared it with a faithful congregation of brothers and sisters. So it has been on continents and islands all around the world. My heart and soul, like yours, longs to shout, \u201cHosanna to the Most High God.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note35\"><sup class=\"marker\">35<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445509\" id=\"p27\">Though we do not stand at the gates of Jerusalem today with palms in our hands, the time will come when, as prophesied in Revelation, \u201ca great multitude, which no man could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and tongues, [will stand] before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed with white robes, and palms in their hands.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note36\"><sup class=\"marker\">36<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445519\" id=\"p28\">I leave with you my blessing as an Apostle of Jesus Christ that you will diligently strive to live righteously and be among those who, with palms in their hands, will herald the Son of God, the great Redeemer of us all.

The Church\u2019s curriculum materials and Latter-day Saint scholarship seem to agree that Jesus held the Last Supper with His disciples in the upper room on the evening before He was crucified.

President Russell M. Nelson has taught: \u201c[Jesus Christ\u2019s] mission was the Atonement. That mission was uniquely His. Born of a mortal mother and an immortal Father, He was the only one who could voluntarily lay down His life and take it up again (see <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/nt/john/10.14-18?lang=eng#p14\">John 10:14\u201318<\/a>). The glorious consequences of His Atonement were infinite and eternal. He took the sting out of death and made temporary the grief of the grave (see <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15.54-55?lang=eng#p54\">1 Corinthians 15:54\u201355<\/a>). His responsibility for the Atonement was known even before the Creation and the Fall. Not only was it to provide for the resurrection and immortality of all humankind, but it was also to enable us to be forgiven of our sins\u2014upon conditions established by Him. Thus His Atonement opened the way by which we could be united with Him and with our families eternally\u201d (\u201c<a class=\"cross-ref\" href=\"/study/liahona/2013/04/the-mission-and-ministry-of-jesus-christ?lang=eng\">The Mission and Ministry of Jesus Christ<\/a>,\u201d <cite>Ensign<\/cite>, Apr. 2013, 34; <cite>Liahona<\/cite>, Apr. 2013, 20).<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"25.\" id=\"note25\" data-full-marker=\"25.\">\n<p data-aid=\"154445673\" id=\"note25_p1\">Resurrection consists of reuniting the body and the spirit in an immortal state, the body and spirit being inseparable and no longer bound to maladies of mortality or death (see <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/11.45?lang=eng#p45\">Alma 11:45<\/a>; <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/40.23?lang=eng#p23\">40:23<\/a>).<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"26.\" id=\"note26\" data-full-marker=\"26.\">\n<p data-aid=\"154445676\" id=\"note26_p1\"><a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.26?lang=eng#p26\">Alma 5:26<\/a>; see also <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.14?lang=eng#p14\">Alma 5:14<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"27.\" id=\"note27\" data-full-marker=\"27.\">\n<p data-aid=\"154445678\" id=\"note27_p1\">The parable of the ten virgins is found in <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/nt/matt/25.1-12?lang=eng#p1\">Matthew 25:1\u201312<\/a>; <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/45.56-59?lang=eng#p56\">Doctrine and Covenants 45:56\u201359<\/a>.

Matthew, Mark, and Luke suggest that the Last Supper took place on \u201cthe first day of the feast of unleavened bread,\u201d or the Passover meal (see <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/nt/matt/26.17?lang=eng#p17\">Matthew 26:17<\/a>; <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/nt/mark/14.12?lang=eng#p12\">Mark 14:12<\/a>; <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/nt/luke/22.1,7?lang=eng#p1\">Luke 22:1, 7<\/a>). John, however, suggests that Jesus was arrested before the Passover meal (see <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/nt/john/18.28?lang=eng#p28\">John 18:28<\/a>), meaning that the Last Supper would have taken place one day earlier than the Passover meal. The Church\u2019s curriculum materials and Latter-day Saint scholarship seem to agree that Jesus held the Last Supper with His disciples in the upper room on the evening before He was crucified. Christians who celebrate Holy Week recognize Thursday as the day of the Last Supper, Friday as the day of the Crucifixion, and Sunday as the day of Resurrection\u2014according to the Gregorian calendar.<\/p>",

When the Father said, \u201cWhom shall I send?\u201d Jesus Christ stepped forward: \u201cHere am I, send me\u201d (<a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/pgp/abr/3.27?lang=eng#p27\">Abraham 3:27<\/a>). President Russell M. Nelson has taught: \u201c[Jesus Christ\u2019s] mission was the Atonement. That mission was uniquely His. Born of a mortal mother and an immortal Father, He was the only one who could voluntarily lay down His life and take it up again (see <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/nt/john/10.14-18?lang=eng#p14\">John 10:14\u201318<\/a>). The glorious consequences of His Atonement were infinite and eternal. He took the sting out of death and made temporary the grief of the grave (see <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15.54-55?lang=eng#p54\">1 Corinthians 15:54\u201355<\/a>). His responsibility for the Atonement was known even before the Creation and the Fall. Not only was it to provide for the resurrection and immortality of all humankind, but it was also to enable us to be forgiven of our sins\u2014upon conditions established by Him. Thus His Atonement opened the way by which we could be united with Him and with our families eternally\u201d (\u201c<a class=\"cross-ref\" href=\"/study/liahona/2013/04/the-mission-and-ministry-of-jesus-christ?lang=eng\">The Mission and Ministry of Jesus Christ<\/a>,\u201d <cite>Ensign<\/cite>, Apr. 2013, 34; <cite>Liahona<\/cite>, Apr. 2013, 20).<\/p>",
