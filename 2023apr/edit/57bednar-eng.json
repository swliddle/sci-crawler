Bednar<\/p>\n<p class=\"author-role\" data-aid=\"154444808\" id=\"author2\">Of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"kicker\" data-aid=\"154444812\" id=\"kicker1\">The Savior\u2019s promise to abide in us is true and available to every covenant-keeping member of His restored Church.<\/p>\n<\/header>\n<div class=\"body-block\">\n<p data-aid=\"154444816\" id=\"p1\">The ancient prophet Enoch, described in the Old Testament, the Doctrine and Covenants, and the Pearl of Great Price,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\">1<\/sup><\/a> was instrumental in establishing the city of Zion.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444820\" id=\"p2\">The scriptural account of Enoch\u2019s call to serve indicates that \u201che heard a voice from heaven, saying: Enoch, my son, prophesy unto this people, and say unto them\u2014Repent, \u2026 for their hearts have waxed hard, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes cannot see afar off.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\">2<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444825\" id=\"p3\">\u201cAnd when Enoch had heard these words, he bowed himself to the earth \u2026 and spake before the Lord, saying: Why is it that I have found favor in thy sight, and am but a lad, and all the people hate me; for I am slow of speech; wherefore am I thy servant?\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\">3<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444828\" id=\"p4\">Please notice that at the time of Enoch\u2019s call to serve, he became acutely aware of his personal inadequacies and limitations. And I suspect all of us at one time or another in our Church service have felt much like Enoch. But I believe the Lord\u2019s response to Enoch\u2019s pleading question is instructive and applies to each of us today.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444834\" id=\"p5\">\u201cAnd the Lord said unto Enoch: Go forth and do as I have commanded thee, and no man shall pierce thee. Open thy mouth, and it shall be filled, and I will give thee utterance. \u2026<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444837\" id=\"p6\">\u201cBehold my Spirit is upon you, wherefore all thy words will I justify; and the mountains shall flee before you, and the rivers shall turn from their course; and thou shalt <em>abide in me, and I in you; therefore walk with me.<\/em>\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\">4<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444840\" id=\"p7\">Enoch ultimately became a mighty prophet and a tool in God\u2019s hands to accomplish a great work, but he did not start his ministry that way! Rather, his capacity over time was magnified as he learned to abide in and walk with the Son of God.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444844\" id=\"p8\">I earnestly pray for the help of the Holy Ghost as we consider together the counsel given to Enoch by the Lord and what it can mean for you and me today.<\/p>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"154444847\" id=\"title2\">Thou Shalt Abide in Me<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"154444851\" id=\"p9\">The Lord Jesus Christ extends to each of us the invitation to abide in Him.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\">5<\/sup><\/a> But how do we actually learn and come to abide in Him?<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444855\" id=\"p10\">The word <em>abide<\/em> denotes remaining fixed or stable and enduring without yielding. Elder Jeffrey R. Holland explained that \u201cabiding\u201d as an action means \u201c\u2018[to] stay\u2014but [to] stay <em>forever<\/em>.\u2019 That is the call of the gospel message to \u2026 everyone \u2026 in the world. Come, but come to remain. Come with conviction and endurance.
