I urge you to choose to be a peacemaker, now and always.<\/p>\n<\/header>\n<div class=\"body-block\">\n<p data-aid=\"154445171\" id=\"p1\">My dear brothers and sisters, it is a joy to be with you. During these past six months, you have been constantly on my mind and in my prayers. I pray that the Holy Ghost will communicate what the Lord wants you to hear as I speak to you now.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445181\" id=\"p2\">During my surgical internship many years ago, I assisted a surgeon who was amputating a leg filled with highly infectious gangrene. The operation was difficult. Then, to add to the tension, one of the team performed a task poorly, and the surgeon erupted in anger. In the middle of his tantrum, he threw his scalpel loaded with germs. It landed in <em>my<\/em> forearm!<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445192\" id=\"p3\">Everyone in the operating room\u2014except the out-of-control surgeon\u2014was horrified by this dangerous breach of surgical practice. Gratefully, I did not become infected. But this experience left a lasting impression on me. In that very hour, I promised myself that <em>whatever<\/em> happened in <em>my<\/em> operating room, I would <em>never<\/em> lose control of my emotions. I also vowed that day never to throw anything in anger\u2014whether it be scalpels or words.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445202\" id=\"p4\">Even now, decades later, I find myself wondering if the contaminated scalpel that landed in my arm was any more toxic than the venomous contention that infects our civic dialogue and too many personal relationships today. Civility and decency seem to have disappeared during this era of polarization and passionate disagreements.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445212\" id=\"p5\">Vulgarity, faultfinding, and evil speaking of others are all too common. Too many pundits, politicians, entertainers, and other influencers throw insults constantly. I am greatly concerned that so many people seem to believe that it is completely acceptable to condemn, malign, and vilify <em>anyone<\/em> who does not agree with them. Many seem eager to damage another\u2019s reputation with pathetic and pithy barbs!<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445223\" id=\"p6\">Anger never persuades. Hostility builds no one. Contention never leads to inspired solutions. Regrettably, we sometimes see contentious behavior even within our own ranks. We hear of those who belittle their spouses and children, of those who use angry outbursts to control others, and of those who punish family members with the \u201csilent treatment.\u201d We hear of youth and children who bully and of employees who defame their colleagues.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445234\" id=\"p7\">My dear brothers and sisters, this should not be. As disciples of Jesus Christ, we are to be examples of how to interact with others\u2014<em>especially<\/em> when we have differences of opinion. One of the easiest ways to identify a <em>true follower<\/em> of Jesus Christ is how compassionately that person treats other people.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445244\" id=\"p8\">The Savior made this clear in His sermons to followers in both hemispheres. \u201cBlessed are the peacemakers,\u201d He said.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\">1<\/sup><\/a> \u201cWhosoever shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\">2<\/sup><\/a> And then, of course, He gave the admonition that challenges each of us: \u201cLove your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\">3<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445256\" id=\"p9\">Before His death, the Savior commanded His Twelve Apostles to love one another as He had loved them.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\">4<\/sup><\/a> And then He added, \u201cBy this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\">5<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445265\" id=\"p10\">The Savior\u2019s message is clear: His <em>true<\/em> disciples build, lift, encourage, persuade, and inspire\u2014no matter how difficult the situation. True disciples of Jesus Christ are peacemakers.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\">6<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445276\" id=\"p11\">Today is Palm Sunday. We are preparing to commemorate the most important and transcendent event ever recorded on earth, which is the Atonement and Resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ. One of the best ways we can honor the Savior is to become a peacemaker.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\">7<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445286\" id=\"p12\">The Savior\u2019s Atonement made it possible for us to overcome <em>all<\/em> evil\u2014including contention. Make no mistake about it: contention <em>is<\/em> evil! Jesus Christ declared that those who have \u201cthe spirit of contention\u201d are not of Him but are \u201cof the devil, who is the father of contention, and [the devil] stirreth up the hearts of men to contend with anger, one with another.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\">8<\/sup><\/a> Those who foster contention are taking a page out of Satan\u2019s playbook, whether they realize it or not. \u201cNo man can serve two masters.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\">9<\/sup><\/a> We cannot support Satan with our verbal assaults and then think that we can still serve God.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445300\" id=\"p13\">My dear brothers and sisters, how we treat each other really matters! How we speak to and about others at home, at church, at work, and online really matters. Today, I am asking us to interact with others in a higher, holier way. Please listen carefully. \u201cIf there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\">10<\/sup><\/a> that we can say about another person\u2014whether to his face or behind her back\u2014that should be <em>our <\/em>standard of communication.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445311\" id=\"p14\">If a couple in your ward gets divorced, or a young missionary returns home early, or a teenager doubts his testimony, they do not need your judgment. They need to experience the pure love of Jesus Christ reflected in your words and actions.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445322\" id=\"p17\">If a friend on social media has strong political or social views that violate everything you believe in, an angry, cutting retort by you will not help. Building bridges of understanding will require much more of you, but that is exactly what your friend needs.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445333\" id=\"p35\">Contention drives away the Spirit\u2014every time. Contention reinforces the false notion that confrontation is the way to resolve differences; but it never is. Contention is a choice. Peacemaking is a choice. You have your agency to choose contention or reconciliation. I urge you to <em>choose<\/em> to be a peacemaker, now and always.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\">11<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445344\" id=\"p18\">Brothers and sisters, we can literally change the world\u2014one person and one interaction at a time. How? By modeling how to manage honest differences of opinion with mutual respect and dignified dialogue.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445355\" id=\"p19\">Differences of opinion are part of life. I work every day with dedicated servants of the Lord who do not always see an issue the same way. They know I want to hear their ideas and honest feelings about everything we discuss\u2014<em>especially<\/em> sensitive issues.<\/p>\n<img id=\"img1\" src=\"https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/c91f96a4240272bf70b93265983fe293d1bb7c74.png\" data-img-id=\"161b39d7ccea11edaa71eeeeac1e21345d54bb6c\" srcset=\"https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/32377f6b4b5fc5a267e37ba6071c0425a4dd286f.png 60w,https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/ea0f2f7564ecac2ae981e206d86f17975dd8c169.png 100w,https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/0b9c07f5fc74a855c037678d89a004989216c50a.png 200w,https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/2697d5822c616cb23e49dc2c4701224bc3a5713b.png 250w,https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/31d33b74c441edd6ef89fd7a6d6bd2ec1da059a1.png 320w,https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/c91f96a4240272bf70b93265983fe293d1bb7c74.png 500w,https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/e26016d19e92f30ed55ae05e61e89935e8127983.png 640w\" data-assetId=\"161b39d7ccea11edaa71eeeeac1e21345d54bb6c\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"323\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.5479876160990713\" alt=\"Dallin H.

Eyring, are exemplary in the way they express their feelings\u2014especially when they may differ. They do so with pure love for each other. Neither suggests that he knows best and therefore must rigorously defend his position. Neither evidences the need to compete with the other.

How I love and honor these two great men!<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445383\" id=\"p21\">Charity is the antidote to contention. Charity is the spiritual gift that helps us to cast off the natural man, who is selfish, defensive, prideful, and jealous. Charity is the principal characteristic of a true follower of Jesus Christ.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\">13<\/sup><\/a> Charity defines a peacemaker.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445394\" id=\"p22\">When we humble ourselves before God and pray with <em>all<\/em> the energy of our hearts, God will grant us charity.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note14\"><sup class=\"marker\">14<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445405\" id=\"p23\">Those blessed with this supernal gift are long-suffering and kind.

Charity propels us \u201cto bear one another\u2019s burdens\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note16\"><sup class=\"marker\">16<\/sup><\/a> rather than heap burdens upon each other. The pure love of Christ allows us \u201cto stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note17\"><sup class=\"marker\">17<\/sup><\/a>\u2014<em>especially<\/em> in tense situations.

You covenant to <em>always<\/em> remember the Savior. In situations that are highly charged and filled with contention, I invite you to remember Jesus Christ. Pray to have the courage and wisdom to say or do what He would. As we follow the Prince of Peace, we will become His peacemakers.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445440\" id=\"p27\">At this point you may be thinking that this message would really help someone you know. Perhaps you are hoping that it will help him or her to be nicer to you. I hope it will!

Note that we also rebuke the adversary every time we heal a misunderstanding or refuse to take offense. Instead, we can show the tender mercy that is characteristic of true disciples of Jesus Christ.
