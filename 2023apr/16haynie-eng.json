But no matter what I did, it was always preceded by the most important thing of all\u2014watching cartoons on television. One such Saturday morning, as I was standing by the television and flipping through channels, I discovered that the cartoon I expected to find had been replaced by a broadcast of the general conference of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. While looking at the television and lamenting that there was no cartoon, I saw a white-haired man in a suit and tie sitting in a nice chair.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444102\" id=\"p2\">There was something different about him, so I asked my oldest brother, \u201cWho is that?\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444103\" id=\"p3\">He said, \u201cThat\u2019s President David O. McKay; he\u2019s a prophet.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444104\" id=\"p4\">I remember feeling something and somehow knowing that he was a prophet. Then, because I was a cartoon-crazed young boy, I changed the channel. But I\u2019ve never forgotten what I felt during that brief, unexpected revelatory moment. With a prophet, sometimes it only takes a moment to know.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\">1<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444105\" id=\"p5\">Knowing by revelation that there is a living prophet on the earth changes everything.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\">2<\/sup><\/a> It causes one to be uninterested in the debate about when is a prophet speaking as a prophet or whether one is ever justified in selective rejection of prophetic counsel.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\">3<\/sup><\/a> Such revealed knowledge invites one to trust the counsel of a living prophet, even if we do not fully understand it.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\">4<\/sup><\/a> After all, a perfect and loving Father in Heaven has chosen the pattern of revealing truth to His children through a prophet, someone who never sought such a sacred calling and who has no need of our help to be aware of his own imperfections.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\">5<\/sup><\/a> A prophet is someone God has personally prepared, called, corrected, inspired, rebuked, sanctified, and sustained.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\">6<\/sup><\/a> That is why we are never spiritually at risk in following prophetic counsel.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444106\" id=\"p6\">Whether we like it or not, all of us were chosen in some fashion in the pre-earth life to be born in these latter days. There are two realities that are associated with the latter days. The first reality is that Christ\u2019s Church will be reestablished on the earth. The second reality is that things are going to get really challenging. The scriptures reveal that in the last days there will be \u201ca great hailstorm sent forth to destroy the crops of the earth,\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\">7<\/sup><\/a> plagues,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\">8<\/sup><\/a> \u201cwars and rumors of wars, and the whole earth shall be in commotion, \u2026 and iniquity shall abound.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\">9<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444107\" id=\"p7\">When I was a child, those prophecies of the last days scared me and caused me to pray that the Second Coming would not come in my lifetime\u2014with some success I might add so far. But now I pray for the opposite, even though the prophesied challenges are assured,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\">10<\/sup><\/a> because when Christ returns to reign, all of His creations will \u201clie down safely.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\">11<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444109\" id=\"p8\">Current conditions in the world have caused some to panic. As God\u2019s covenant children, we do not need to chase after this or that to know how to navigate through these troubled times. We do not need to fear.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\">12<\/sup><\/a> The doctrine and principles that we must follow to survive spiritually and endure physically are found in the words of a living prophet.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\">13<\/sup><\/a> That is why President M. Russell Ballard declared that \u201cit is no small thing \u2026 to have a prophet of God in our midst.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note14\"><sup class=\"marker\">14<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444110\" id=\"p9\">President Russell M. Nelson has testified that \u201cGod\u2019s long-established pattern of teaching His children through prophets assures us that He will bless each prophet and that He will bless those who heed prophetic counsel.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note15\"><sup class=\"marker\">15<\/sup><\/a> So the key is to follow the living prophet.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note16\"><sup class=\"marker\">16<\/sup><\/a> Brothers and sisters, unlike vintage comic books and classic cars, prophetic teachings do not become more valuable with age. That is why we should not seek to use the words of past prophets to dismiss the teachings of living prophets.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note17\"><sup class=\"marker\">17<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444112\" id=\"p10\">I love the parables used by Jesus Christ to teach gospel principles. I would like to share a real-life parable of sorts with you this morning.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444116\" id=\"p11\">One day I walked into the cafeteria at Church headquarters to have some lunch. After getting a tray of food, I entered the dining area and noticed a table at which all three members of the First Presidency were seated, along with one empty chair. My insecurities caused me to make a quick detour away from that table, and then I heard the voice of our prophet, President Russell M. Nelson, saying, \u201cAllen, there\u2019s an empty chair right here. Come and sit down with us.\u201d And so I did. <\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444118\" id=\"p12\">Near the end of the lunch, I was surprised to hear a loud crunching noise, and when I looked up, I saw that President Nelson had stood his plastic water bottle straight up and then flattened it and replaced the lid. <\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444120\" id=\"p13\">President Dallin H. Oaks then asked the question I wanted to ask, \u201cPresident Nelson, why did you flatten your plastic water bottle?\u201d <\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444122\" id=\"p14\">He replied, \u201cIt makes it easier for those who are handling recyclable materials because it doesn\u2019t take up as much space in the recycling container.\u201d <\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444124\" id=\"p15\">While pondering that response, I heard the same crunching sound again. I looked to my right, and President Oaks had flattened his plastic water bottle just like President Nelson. I then heard some noise to my left, and President Henry B. Eyring was flattening his plastic water bottle, although he had adopted a different strategy by doing it while the bottle was horizontal, which took more effort than with the bottle straight up. Noticing this, President Nelson kindly showed him the bottle-straight-up technique to more easily flatten the bottle. <\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444126\" id=\"p16\">At that point, I leaned over to President Oaks and quietly asked, \u201cIs flattening your plastic water bottle a new recycling requirement of the cafeteria?\u201d <\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444128\" id=\"p17\">President Oaks responded, with a smile on his face, \u201cWell, Allen, you need to follow the prophet.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444130\" id=\"p18\">I\u2019m confident that President Nelson was not declaring some new recycling-based doctrine in the cafeteria that day. But we can learn from the prompt response<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note18\"><sup class=\"marker\">18<\/sup><\/a> of President Oaks and President Eyring to President Nelson\u2019s example and President Nelson\u2019s attentiveness to help teach those involved a better way.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note19\"><sup class=\"marker\">19<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444131\" id=\"p19\">A number of years ago, Elder Neal A. Maxwell shared some observations and counsel that are prophetically on point with respect to our day:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444132\" id=\"p20\">\u201cIn the months and years ahead, events are likely to require each member to decide whether or not he [or she] will follow the First Presidency. Members will find it more difficult to halt longer between two opinions. \u2026<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444133\" id=\"p22\">\u201c\u2026 Let us leave a record so that the choices are clear, letting others do as they will in the face of prophetic counsel. \u2026 <\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444134\" id=\"p23\">\u201cJesus said that when the fig trees put forth their leaves, \u2018summer is nigh.\u2019 \u2026 Thus warned that summer is upon us, let us not then complain of the heat!\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note20\"><sup class=\"marker\">20<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444135\" id=\"p24\">The rising generation is growing up in a time when there are more fig leaves and there is more heat. That reality imposes a weightier responsibility on the already risen generation, particularly when it comes to following prophetic counsel. When parents ignore the counsel of the living prophet, they not only lose the promised blessings for themselves but even more tragically teach their children that what a prophet says is insignificant or that prophetic counsel can be picked through in a smorgasbord fashion without concern for the resulting spiritual malnutrition. <\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444136\" id=\"p28\">Elder Richard L. Evans once observed: \u201cSome parents mistakenly feel that they can relax a little as to conduct and conformity \u2026 that they can ease up a little on the fundamentals without affecting their family or their family\u2019s future.
