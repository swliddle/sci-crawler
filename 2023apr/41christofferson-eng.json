Oaks has noted, today is Palm Sunday, the start of Holy Week, marking the Lord\u2019s triumphal entry into Jerusalem, His suffering in Gethsemane and death on the cross just days later, and His glorious Resurrection on Easter Sunday. Let us resolve never to forget what Christ endured to redeem us.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\">1<\/sup><\/a> And let us never lose the overwhelming joy we will feel once again on Easter as we contemplate His victory over the grave and the gift of universal resurrection.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444392\" id=\"p2\">The evening before the trials and crucifixion that awaited Him, Jesus joined in a Passover meal with His Apostles. At the end of this Last Supper, in a sacred Intercessory Prayer, Jesus petitioned His Father in these words: \u201cHoly Father, keep through thine own name [mine Apostles] whom thou hast given me, that they may be one, as we are.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\">2<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444397\" id=\"p3\">Then, tenderly, the Savior expanded His petition to include all believers:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444404\" id=\"p4\">\u201cNeither pray I for these alone, but for them also which shall believe on me through their word;<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444409\" id=\"p5\">\u201cThat they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\">3<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444414\" id=\"p6\">Becoming one is a recurring theme in the gospel of Jesus Christ and in God\u2019s dealings with His children. With respect to the city of Zion in Enoch\u2019s day, it is said that \u201cthey were of one heart and one mind.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\">4<\/sup><\/a> Of the early Saints in the primitive Church of Jesus Christ, the New Testament records, \u201cThe multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\">5<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444419\" id=\"p7\">In our own dispensation, the Lord admonished, \u201cI say unto you, be one; and if ye are not one ye are not mine.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\">6<\/sup><\/a> Among the reasons the Lord gave as to why the early Saints in Missouri had failed to establish a place of Zion was that they \u201care not united according to the union required by the law of the celestial kingdom.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\">7<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444424\" id=\"p8\">Where God prevails in all hearts and minds, the people are described as \u201c<em>in one<\/em>, the children of Christ.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\">8<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444429\" id=\"p9\">When the resurrected Savior appeared to the ancient Book of Mormon peoples, He noted with disapproval that in the past there had been disputations among the people about baptism and other matters. He commanded:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444434\" id=\"p33\">\u201cThere shall be no disputations among you, as there have hitherto been; neither shall there be disputations among you concerning the points of my doctrine, as there have hitherto been.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444439\" id=\"p34\">\u201cFor verily, verily I say unto you, he that hath the spirit of contention is not of me, but is of the devil, who is the father of contention.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\">9<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444445\" id=\"p10\">In our extremely contentious world, how can unity be achieved, especially in the Church, where we are to have \u201cone Lord, one faith, one baptism\u201d?<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\">10<\/sup><\/a> Paul gives us the key:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444450\" id=\"p35\">\u201cFor as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444455\" id=\"p36\">\u201cThere is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor female: for ye are all one in Christ.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\">11<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444458\" id=\"p37\">We are too diverse and at times too discordant to be able to come together as one on any other basis or under any other name. Only in Jesus Christ can we truly become one.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444464\" id=\"p11\">Becoming one in Christ happens one by one\u2014we each begin with ourselves. We are dual beings of flesh and spirit and are sometimes at war within ourselves. As Paul expressed:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444469\" id=\"p12\">\u201cFor I delight in the law of God after the inward man;<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444474\" id=\"p13\">\u201cBut I see another law in [the] members [of my body], warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\">12<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444480\" id=\"p14\">Jesus was also a being of flesh and spirit. He was tested; He understands; He can help us achieve unity within.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\">13<\/sup><\/a> Therefore, drawing upon the light and the grace of Christ, we strive to give our spirit\u2014and the Holy Spirit\u2014dominance over the physical. And when we fall short, Christ, by His Atonement, has given us the gift of repentance and the opportunity to try again.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444485\" id=\"p15\">If individually we each \u201cput on Christ,\u201d then together we can hope to become one, as Paul said, \u201cthe body of Christ.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note14\"><sup class=\"marker\">14<\/sup><\/a> To \u201cput on Christ\u201d certainly includes making His \u201cfirst and great commandment\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note15\"><sup class=\"marker\">15<\/sup><\/a> our first and greatest commitment, and if we love God, we will keep His commandments.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note16\"><sup class=\"marker\">16<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444490\" id=\"p16\">Unity with our brothers and sisters in the body of Christ grows as we heed the second commandment\u2014inextricably connected to the first\u2014to love others as ourselves.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note17\"><sup class=\"marker\">17<\/sup><\/a> And I suppose an even more perfect unity would obtain among us if we followed the Savior\u2019s higher and holier expression of this second commandment\u2014to love one another not only as we love ourselves but as <em>He<\/em> loved us.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note18\"><sup class=\"marker\">18<\/sup><\/a> In sum, it is \u201cevery man seeking the interest of his neighbor, and doing all things with an eye single to the glory of God.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note19\"><sup class=\"marker\">19<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444495\" id=\"p17\">President Marion G. Romney, a former counselor in the First Presidency, in explaining how enduring peace and unity are obtained, said:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444501\" id=\"p18\">\u201cIf a single person, yielding to Satan, is filled with the works of the flesh, he wars within himself. If two yield, they each war within themselves and fight with each other. If many people yield, a society [reaps] the harvest of great stress and contention. If the rulers of a country yield, there is world-wide contention.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444507\" id=\"p19\">President Romney continued: \u201cAs the works of the flesh have universal application, so likewise does the gospel of peace. If one man lives it, he has peace within himself. If two men live it, they each have peace within themselves and with each other. If the citizens live it, the nation has domestic peace. When there are enough nations enjoying the fruit of the Spirit to control world affairs, then, and only then, will the war-drums throb no longer, and the battle flags be furl\u2019d. \u2026 (See Alfred Lord Tennyson, \u201cLocksley Hall,\u201d <cite>The Complete Poetical Works of Tennyson<\/cite>, ed. W. J. Rolfe, Boston: Houghton-Mifflin Co., 1898, p. 93, lines 27\u201328.)\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note20\"><sup class=\"marker\">20<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444511\" id=\"p20\">When we \u201cput on Christ,\u201d it becomes possible either to resolve or to lay aside differences, disagreements, and disputes. A rather dramatic example of overcoming division is found in our Church history. Elder Brigham Henry Roberts (commonly known as B. H. Roberts), born in England in 1857, served as a member of the First Council of the Seventy\u2014what we refer to today as the Presidency of the Seventy. Elder Roberts was an able and tireless defender of the restored gospel and of the Church in some of its most difficult times.<\/p>\n<img id=\"img2\" src=\"https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/3d4d5e8fc24341567acce73a25d87e4f3efb709c.png\" data-img-id=\"cf3dbf1dcce911ed8cddeeeeac1e01d3e522b9a1\" srcset=\"https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/943cb0a9f67503f02da57f77bb32adb9a9b78439.png 60w,https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/4f98df9235081c80d256ae3619c0245b952e27b2.png 100w,https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/ddd74d07caf9c9d15b515f90b317fdccea8235d0.png 200w,https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/3d98a4658580a1b99c3973c2da31117a38032706.png 250w,https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/ce0789623d544013fd806a5d161cc5a7aad86ca9.png 320w,https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/3d4d5e8fc24341567acce73a25d87e4f3efb709c.png 500w,https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/5dbb5fb0398a047fbc2d7f601d7b053e99de8f18.png 640w\" data-assetId=\"cf3dbf1dcce911ed8cddeeeeac1e01d3e522b9a1\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"323\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.5479876160990713\" alt=\"Photograph of B.H.

B. H. had been appointed as a delegate to the convention that drafted a constitution for Utah when it became a state. Afterward, he decided to become a candidate for the United States Congress but did not notify or seek permission from the First Presidency. President Joseph F. Smith, a counselor in the First Presidency, censured B. H. for that failure in a general priesthood meeting. Elder Roberts lost the election and felt his defeat was due in large part to President Smith\u2019s statements. He was critical of Church leaders in some political speeches and interviews. He withdrew from active Church service. In a lengthy meeting in the Salt Lake Temple with members of the First Presidency and Council of the Twelve, B. H. remained adamant in justifying himself. Later, \u201cPresident [Wilford] Woodruff gave [Elder Roberts] three weeks to reconsider his position. If he remained unrepentant, they would release him from the Seventy.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note21\"><sup class=\"marker\">21<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444524\" id=\"p22\">In a subsequent private meeting with Apostles Heber J. Grant and Francis Lyman, B. H. was initially unyielding, but love and the Holy Spirit ultimately prevailed. Tears came to his eyes. The two Apostles were able to respond to certain perceived slights and offenses that troubled B. H., and they left with a heartfelt plea for reconciliation. The next morning, after lengthy prayer, Elder Roberts sent a note to Elders Grant and Lyman that he was prepared to reunite with his brethren.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note22\"><sup class=\"marker\">22<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444531\" id=\"p23\">When he later met with the First Presidency, Elder Roberts said, \u201cI went to the Lord and received light and instruction through His Spirit to submit to the authority of God.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note23\"><sup class=\"marker\">23<\/sup><\/a> Motivated by his love of God, B. H. Roberts remained a faithful and an able Church leader to the end of his life.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note24\"><sup class=\"marker\">24<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<img id=\"img3\" src=\"https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/7bf301df19d4c32d0fe26f753d57e5716d160bd9.png\" data-img-id=\"cd5528f8cce911edbb90eeeeac1ee52e3db215df\" srcset=\"https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/136c4c23621aee006aabeb9ae5666d7a9b7a46e8.png 60w,https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/05cdab2a03d02db85156b59c38097f69e1c840c9.png 100w,https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/eda7eba36d0799019398bcfb2af626c88caf6313.png 200w,https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/ee889d31879097b040f1562715abac8d1c59fbb4.png 250w,https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/6dfcb1799297d4961285712c9e9b11678322ce66.png 320w,https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/7bf301df19d4c32d0fe26f753d57e5716d160bd9.png 500w,https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/14fabc5b575bfcaf219fdf1179e95f1b3feeae78.png 640w\" data-assetId=\"cd5528f8cce911edbb90eeeeac1ee52e3db215df\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"323\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.5479876160990713\" alt=\"Brigham H.

We cannot be one unless we all bend our efforts to the common cause. It means, in B. H. Roberts\u2019s words, submitting to the authority of God. We are different members of the body of Christ, fulfilling different functions at different times\u2014the ear, the eye, the head, the hand, the feet\u2014yet all of one body.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note25\"><sup class=\"marker\">25<\/sup><\/a> Therefore, our goal is \u201cthat there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note26\"><sup class=\"marker\">26<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444541\" id=\"p25\">Unity does not require sameness, but it does require harmony. We can have our hearts knit together in love, be one in faith and doctrine, and still cheer for different teams, disagree on various political issues, debate about goals and the right way to achieve them, and many other such things. But we can never disagree or contend with anger or contempt for one another. Said the Savior:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444547\" id=\"p26\">\u201cFor verily, verily I say unto you, he that hath the spirit of contention is not of me, but is of the devil, who is the father of contention, and he stirreth up the hearts of men to contend with anger, one with another.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444553\" id=\"p27\">\u201cBehold, this is not my doctrine, to stir up the hearts of men with anger, one against another; but this is my doctrine, that such things should be done away.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note27\"><sup class=\"marker\">27<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444559\" id=\"p28\">A year ago, President Russell M. Nelson pled with us in these words: \u201cNone of us can control nations or the actions of others or even members of our own families. But we can control ourselves. My call today, dear brothers and sisters, is to end conflicts that are raging in <em>your<\/em> heart, <em>your<\/em> home, and <em>your<\/em> life. Bury any and all inclinations to hurt others\u2014whether those inclinations be a temper, a sharp tongue, or a resentment for someone who has hurt you. The Savior commanded us to turn the other cheek [see <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/12.39?lang=eng#p39\">3 Nephi 12:39<\/a>], to love our enemies, and to pray for those who despitefully use us [see <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/12.44?lang=eng#p44\">3 Nephi 12:44<\/a>].\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note28\"><sup class=\"marker\">28<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444565\" id=\"p30\">I say again that it is only in and through our individual loyalty to and love of Jesus Christ that we can hope to be one\u2014one within, one at home, one in the Church, eventually one in Zion, and above all, one with the Father and the Son and the Holy Ghost.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444572\" id=\"p31\">I return to the events of Holy Week and the ultimate triumph of our Redeemer. The Resurrection of Jesus Christ bears witness of His divinity and that He has overcome all things. His Resurrection bears witness that, bound to Him by covenant, we too may overcome all things and become one. His Resurrection bears witness that through Him, immortality and eternal life are realities.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444578\" id=\"p32\">This morning, I bear witness of His literal Resurrection and all that it implies, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<footer class=\"notes\">\n<p class=\"title\" data-aid=\"154444583\" id=\"note_title1\">Notes<\/p>\n<ol class=\"decimal\" data-type=\"marker\" start=\"1\">\n<li data-marker=\"1.\" id=\"note1\" data-full-marker=\"1.\">\n<p data-aid=\"154444587\" id=\"note1_p1\">See <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/19.18-19?lang=eng#p18\">Doctrine and Covenants 19:18\u201319<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"2.\" id=\"note2\" data-full-marker=\"2.\">\n<p data-aid=\"154444590\" id=\"note2_p1\"><a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/nt/john/17.11?lang=eng#p11\">John 17:11<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"3.\" id=\"note3\" data-full-marker=\"3.\">\n<p data-aid=\"154444598\" id=\"note3_p1\"><a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/nt/john/17.20-21?lang=eng#p20\">John 17:20\u201321<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"4.\" id=\"note4\" data-full-marker=\"4.\">\n<p data-aid=\"154444601\" id=\"note4_p1\"><a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/7.18?lang=eng#p18\">Moses 7:18<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"5.\" id=\"note5\" data-full-marker=\"5.\">\n<p data-aid=\"154444606\" id=\"note5_p1\"><a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/nt/acts/4.32?lang=eng#p32\">Acts 4:32<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"6.\" id=\"note6\" data-full-marker=\"6.\">\n<p data-aid=\"154444610\" id=\"note6_p1\"><a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/38.27?lang=eng#p27\">Doctrine and Covenants 38:27<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"7.\" id=\"note7\" data-full-marker=\"7.\">\n<p data-aid=\"154444615\" id=\"note7_p1\"><a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/105.4?lang=eng#p4\">Doctrine and Covenants 105:4<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"8.\" id=\"note8\" data-full-marker=\"8.\">\n<p data-aid=\"154444621\" id=\"note8_p1\"><a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/bofm/4-ne/1.17?lang=eng#p17\">4 Nephi 1:17<\/a>, emphasis added;
