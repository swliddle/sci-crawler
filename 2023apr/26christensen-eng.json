Christensen<\/p>\n<p class=\"author-role\" data-aid=\"154444192\" id=\"author2\">Of the Seventy<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"kicker\" data-aid=\"154444196\" id=\"kicker1\">Repenting daily and coming unto Jesus Christ is the way to experience joy\u2014joy beyond our imagination.<\/p>\n<\/header>\n<div class=\"body-block\">\n<p data-aid=\"154444199\" id=\"p1\">Throughout His mortal ministry, the Savior showed great compassion for all of God\u2019s children\u2014especially for those who were suffering or had fallen away. When criticized by the Pharisees for associating with and eating among sinners, Jesus responded by teaching three familiar parables.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\">1<\/sup><\/a> In each of these parables, He emphasized the importance of seeking out those who had strayed and the joy that is felt when they return. For example, in the parable of the lost sheep, He said, \u201c[Great] joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\">2<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444203\" id=\"p2\">My desire today is to strengthen the connection between joy and repentance\u2014more specifically, the joy that comes when we repent and the feelings of joy we experience as we invite others to come unto Christ and receive His atoning sacrifice in their lives.<\/p>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"154444208\" id=\"title2\">We Are That We Might Have Joy<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"154444211\" id=\"p3\">In the scriptures, the word <i>joy<\/i> typically means much more than passing moments of contentment or even feelings of happiness. Joy in this context is a godly attribute, found in its fulness when we return to dwell in the presence of God.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\">3<\/sup><\/a> It is more profound, elevating, enduring, and life-changing than any pleasure or comfort this world can offer.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444217\" id=\"p4\">We were created to have joy. It is our intended destiny as children of a loving Heavenly Father. He wants to share His joy with us. The prophet Lehi taught that God\u2019s plan for each of us is that we \u201cmight have joy.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\">4<\/sup><\/a> Because we live in a fallen world, enduring joy or everlasting joy often seems beyond our reach. Yet in the very next verse, Lehi continues by explaining that \u201cthe Messiah [came to] \u2026 redeem [us] from the fall.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\">5<\/sup><\/a> Redemption, by and through the Savior Jesus Christ, makes joy possible.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444221\" id=\"p5\">The gospel message is a message of hope, of \u201cgood tidings of great joy,\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\">6<\/sup><\/a> and the means whereby all can experience peace and occasions of joy in this life and receive a fulness of joy in the life to come.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\">7<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444227\" id=\"p6\">The joy we speak of is a gift for the faithful, yet it comes with a price. Joy is not cheap or casually given. Rather, it is bought \u201cwith the precious blood of [Jesus] Christ.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\">8<\/sup><\/a> If we really understood the value of true, godly joy, we would not hesitate to sacrifice any worldly possession or make any necessary life changes to receive it.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444234\" id=\"p7\">A powerful but humble king in the Book of Mormon understood this. \u201cWhat shall I do,\u201d he asked, \u201cthat I may be born of God, having this wicked spirit rooted out of my breast, and receive his Spirit, that I may be filled with joy \u2026 ? Behold, said he, I will give up all that I possess, yea, I will forsake my kingdom, that I may receive this great joy.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\">9<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444239\" id=\"p8\">In response to the king\u2019s question, the missionary Aaron said, \u201cIf thou desirest this thing, \u2026 bow down before God \u2026 [and] repent of all thy sins.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\">10<\/sup><\/a> Repentance is the pathway to joy<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\">11<\/sup><\/a> because it is the pathway that leads to the Savior Jesus Christ.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\">12<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"154444244\" id=\"title3\">Joy Comes through Sincere Repentance<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"154444247\" id=\"p9\">For some, to think of repentance as the pathway to joy might seem contradictory. Repentance, at times, can be painful and difficult. It requires admitting that some of our thoughts and actions\u2014even some of our beliefs\u2014have been wrong. Repentance also requires change, which, at times, can be uncomfortable. But joy and comfort are not the same thing. Sin\u2014including the sin of complacency\u2014limits our joy.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444252\" id=\"p10\">As stated by the psalmist, \u201cWeeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\">13<\/sup><\/a> As we repent of our sins, we must focus on the great joy that follows. The nights may seem long, but the morning does come, and oh, how exquisite is the peace and resplendent joy we feel as the Savior\u2019s Atonement frees us from sin and suffering.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"154444257\" id=\"title4\">There Can Be Nothing So Exquisite and Sweet<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"154444263\" id=\"p11\">Consider the experience of Alma in the Book of Mormon. He was \u201cracked with eternal torment,\u201d and his soul was \u201charrowed up\u201d because of his sins. But once he turned to the Savior for mercy, he \u201ccould remember [his] pains no more.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note14\"><sup class=\"marker\">14<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444268\" id=\"p12\">\u201cAnd oh, what joy,\u201d he declared, \u201cand what marvelous light I did behold; yea, \u2026 there can be nothing so exquisite and sweet as was my joy.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note15\"><sup class=\"marker\">15<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444273\" id=\"p13\">This is the kind of joy available to those who come unto Jesus Christ through repentance.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note16\"><sup class=\"marker\">16<\/sup><\/a> As President Russell M. Nelson has taught:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444280\" id=\"p24\">\u201cRepentance opens our access to the power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ. \u2026<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444286\" id=\"p25\">\u201cWhen we choose to repent, we choose to change! We allow the Savior to transform us into the best version of ourselves. We choose to grow spiritually and receive joy\u2014the joy of redemption in Him. When we choose to repent, we choose to become more like Jesus Christ!\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note17\"><sup class=\"marker\">17<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444290\" id=\"p14\">Repentance brings joy because it prepares our hearts to receive the influence of the Holy Ghost. To be filled with the Holy Ghost means to be filled with joy. And to be filled with joy means to be filled with the Holy Ghost.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note18\"><sup class=\"marker\">18<\/sup><\/a> Our joy increases as we work daily to bring the Spirit into our lives. As taught by the prophet Mormon, \u201cNevertheless they did fast and pray oft, and did wax stronger and stronger in their humility, and firmer and firmer in [their] faith [in] Christ, unto the filling their souls with joy and consolation.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note19\"><sup class=\"marker\">19<\/sup><\/a> The Lord promises all who work to follow Him, \u201cI will impart unto you \u2026 my Spirit, which shall enlighten your mind, which shall fill your soul with joy.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note20\"><sup class=\"marker\">20<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"154444295\" id=\"title5\">The Joy of Helping Others Repent<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"154444299\" id=\"p15\">After we have felt the joy that comes from sincere repentance, we quite naturally want to share that joy with others. As we do, our joy multiplies.
