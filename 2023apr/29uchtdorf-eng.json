His four-year-old daughter stepped in front of him, wearing pajamas and holding a copy of <cite>Book of Mormon Stories<\/cite>.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444329\" id=\"p8\">\u201cWhy do you have to go to a meeting?\u201d she asked.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444335\" id=\"p9\">\u201cBecause I am a counselor in the bishopric,\u201d he answered.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444340\" id=\"p10\">\u201cBut you are my dad!\u201d his daughter protested.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444345\" id=\"p11\">He knelt in front of her. \u201cSweetheart,\u201d he said, \u201cI know you want me to read to you and help you go to sleep, but tonight I need to help the bishop.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444350\" id=\"p12\">His daughter replied, \u201cDoesn\u2019t the bishop have a dad to help him go to sleep?\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444356\" id=\"p13\">We are eternally grateful for the countless members who serve diligently in the Church of Jesus Christ every day. Your sacrifice is truly sacred.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444361\" id=\"p14\">But as this girl seemed to understand, there\u2019s something equally sacred\u2014something irreplaceable\u2014about a parent nurturing a child. It reflects the pattern of heaven.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\">1<\/sup><\/a> Our Father in Heaven, our Divine Parent, surely rejoices when His children are taught and nurtured by their parents on earth.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\">2<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154444367\" id=\"p15\">Parents, thank you for everything you\u2019re doing to raise your children. And children, thank you for everything you\u2019re doing to raise your parents, because as every parent knows, we often learn as much from our children about faith, hope, and charity as they learn from us!<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\">3<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"154444374\" id=\"p16\">Parents Have a Sacred Duty<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"154444380\" id=\"p17\">Have you ever thought about the tremendous risk our Father in Heaven takes each time He sends a child to earth? These are His spirit sons and daughters. They have limitless potential. They are destined to become glorious beings of goodness, grace, and truth. And yet they come to earth completely helpless, barely able to do anything besides cry for help. The memory of their time in God\u2019s presence is veiled over, along with the knowledge of who they really are and who they can become.

This is part of the miracle of Heavenly Father\u2019s plan. He wants His children to come to earth, following the eternal pattern of families that exists in heaven. Families are the basic organizational unit of the eternal realms, and so He intends for them also to be the basic unit on earth. Though earthly families are far from perfect, they give God\u2019s children the best chance to be welcomed to the world with the only love on earth that comes close to what we felt in heaven\u2014parental love.

This is part of the miracle of Heavenly Father\u2019s plan. He wants His children to come to earth, following the eternal pattern of families that exists in heaven. Families are the basic organizational unit of the eternal realms, and so He intends for them also to be the basic unit on earth. Though earthly families are far from perfect, they give God\u2019s children the best chance to be welcomed to the world with the only love on earth that comes close to what we felt in heaven\u2014parental love.
