Specifically, He has overcome four problems that every one of us faces and that not one of us can solve on our own:<\/p>\n<ol class=\"decimal\" start=\"1\">\n<li data-marker=\"1.\">\n<p data-aid=\"154444066\" id=\"p3\">The first problem is physical death. We can try to delay it or ignore it, but we can\u2019t overcome it on our own. Jesus Christ, however, overcame death for us, and as a consequence, we will all be resurrected one day.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\">1<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"2.\">\n<p data-aid=\"154444070\" id=\"p4\">The second problem includes the tribulations, difficult experiences, sadness, pain, and unfairness of this world. Jesus Christ overcame all of this. For those who strive to follow Him, He will one day \u201cwipe away all tears\u201d and make things right again.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\">2<\/sup><\/a> In the meantime, He can strengthen us to pass through our trials with confidence, good cheer, and peace.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\">3<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"3.\">\n<p data-aid=\"154444076\" id=\"p5\">The third problem is spiritual death arising from sin. Jesus Christ overcame this problem by taking upon Himself \u201cthe chastisement of our peace.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\">4<\/sup><\/a> Because of His atoning sacrifice, we can be freed from the consequences of our sins if we have faith in the Savior, sincerely repent, accept the covenant the Father offers us through essential ordinances such as baptism, and endure to the end.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\">5<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"4.\">\n<p data-aid=\"154444082\" id=\"p6\">The fourth problem is our limited, imperfect natures. Jesus Christ has the solution to this problem too. He doesn\u2019t just erase our errors and make us innocent again. He can work \u201ca mighty change in \u2026 our hearts, that we have no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\">6<\/sup><\/a> We can be perfected by the grace of Christ and one day become like Him.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\">7<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p data-aid=\"154444090\" id=\"p7\">Unfortunately, too often we concentrate so much on our own problems that we lose focus on the solution, our Savior, Jesus Christ. How do we avoid that mistake? I believe the answer lies in the covenants we are invited to make with Him and our Father in Heaven.<\/p>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"154445097\" id=\"title2\">Focusing on Jesus Christ through Covenants<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"154445104\" id=\"p8\">Our covenants help us focus our attention, our thoughts, and our actions on Christ. As we \u201ccleave unto the covenants [we have] made,\u201d we can more easily identify \u201cthe things of this world\u201d that we should \u201clay aside\u201d and \u201cthe things of a better [world]\u201d we should diligently seek.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\">8<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445111\" id=\"p9\">That\u2019s what the people of Ammon did in the Book of Mormon. As they learned of Jesus Christ and began to focus their lives on Him, they recognized that they should bury their weapons of war and became perfectly honest and \u201cdistinguished for their zeal towards God.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\">9<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445119\" id=\"p10\">Covenant keeping leads us to seek after whatever invites the influence of the Spirit and reject whatever drives it away\u2014\u201cfor we know that if we can be worthy of the presence of the Holy Ghost, we can also be worthy to live in the presence of Heavenly Father and His Son, Jesus Christ.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\">10<\/sup><\/a> This may mean that we have to change our vocabulary, using kinder words. It could mean replacing spiritually unhealthy habits with new habits that strengthen our relationship with the Lord, such as daily prayer and scripture study, individually and with our family.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445127\" id=\"p11\">President Russell M. Nelson said that \u201ceach person who makes covenants in baptismal fonts and in temples\u2014and keeps them\u2014has increased access to the power of Jesus Christ. \u2026 <\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445136\" id=\"p23\">\u201cThe reward for keeping covenants with God is heavenly power\u2014power that strengthens us to withstand our trials, temptations, and heartaches better.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\">11<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445145\" id=\"p12\">Renewing our covenants during the sacrament each Sunday is a great opportunity to examine ourselves<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\">12<\/sup><\/a> and refocus our lives on Jesus Christ. By partaking of the sacrament, we declare that we do \u201calways remember him.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\">13<\/sup><\/a> The word <i>always<\/i> is so significant. It extends the Savior\u2019s influence into every part of our lives. We don\u2019t remember Him only at church or only during our morning prayers or only when we\u2019re in trouble and we need something. <\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445153\" id=\"p24\">Yes, we sometimes get distracted. We forget. We lose our focus. But renewing our covenants means that we <em>want<\/em> to always remember the Savior, that we will try to do so throughout the week, and that we will recommit and refocus on Him again at the sacrament table next week.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"154445162\" id=\"title3\">Focusing on Jesus Christ in Our Homes<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"154445169\" id=\"p13\">Clearly, focusing on Jesus Christ must be more than a Sunday, at-church activity. When President Nelson introduced <em>Come, Follow Me<\/em> in 2018, he said, \u201cIt is time for a <em>home-centered Church<\/em>.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note14\"><sup class=\"marker\">14<\/sup><\/a> He said we should \u201ctransform [our] home into a sanctuary of faith\u201d and \u201ca center of gospel learning.\u201d And he made four wonderful promises to us if we do.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note15\"><sup class=\"marker\">15<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445179\" id=\"p14\"><em>The first promise:<\/em> \u201c<em>Your<\/em> Sabbath days will truly be a delight.\u201d It will become a day when we draw closer to our Savior. As a young woman from Peru said, \u201cThe Lord\u2019s day is the day I get the most answers from the Lord.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445189\" id=\"p15\"><em>The second promise:<\/em> \u201c<em>Your<\/em> children will be excited to learn and to live the Savior\u2019s teachings.\u201d That is why \u201cwe talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, \u2026 that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission of their sins.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note16\"><sup class=\"marker\">16<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445199\" id=\"p16\">We do this so that one day, when our son goes out to work or to hike in the mountains or to hunt beasts in the forests, as Enos did, he may remember what we taught him about Christ and about the joy of living the gospel. And who knows? Maybe this will be the day when he will finally feel the spiritual hunger that turns him to Jesus Christ so he can hear the voice of the Lord saying to him, \u201cThy sins are forgiven thee, and thou shalt be blessed.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note17\"><sup class=\"marker\">17<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445209\" id=\"p17\"><em>The third promise:<\/em> \u201cThe influence of the adversary in <em>your<\/em> life and in <em>your<\/em> home will decrease.\u201d Why? Because the more we focus on Jesus Christ, the more sin loses its appeal.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note18\"><sup class=\"marker\">18<\/sup><\/a> As our homes are filled with the Savior\u2019s light, there is less and less room for the darkness of the adversary.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445220\" id=\"p18\"><em>The fourth promise:<\/em> \u201cChanges in your family will be dramatic and sustaining.\u201d Why? Because the change that Jesus Christ brings is \u201ca mighty change.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note19\"><sup class=\"marker\">19<\/sup><\/a> He changes our very natures; we become \u201cnew creatures.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note20\"><sup class=\"marker\">20<\/sup><\/a> We gradually become more like the Savior, filled with His pure love for all of God\u2019s children.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445231\" id=\"p19\">Who wouldn\u2019t want these promises fulfilled in their lives and in their families? What do we need to do to obtain them? The answer is to transform our homes into a sanctuary of faith and a center of gospel learning. And how do we do that? By focusing on Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, making Them the center of our family life, the most important influence in our home.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445242\" id=\"p20\">Could I suggest that you begin by making the words of Christ, found in the scriptures, a daily part of your life? There is no prescribed formula for perfect scripture study. It could be 5 or 10 minutes each day\u2014or more if you can. It could be a chapter or a few verses a day. Some families prefer to study in the morning before they leave for school or work. Others prefer to read at night before bed. Some young couples have told me that they study individually on the way to work and then share insights with each other via text so their comments and discussions are recorded.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"154445253\" id=\"p21\"><em>Come, Follow Me<\/em> provides many suggestions of activities and resources that can help individuals and families learn gospel principles from the scriptures. The Bible videos and the Book of Mormon videos can also be valuable tools to make the scriptures more accessible to your family. Youth and children are often inspired by the memorable stories in the scriptures. These stories and the gospel principles they teach will stay with your children, like trusted friends, when they need good examples of service, virtue, obedience, patience, perseverance, personal revelation, charity, humility, and faith in Jesus Christ.
