Encountering thick clouds, Robert and Meryl lost visual and radio contact with each other. Robert quickly landed, where he learned his wife\u2019s plane had crashed.

Profound tears of sorrow simply wouldn\u2019t stop flowing. To make matters worse, as my mind was attempting to deal with the devastating realization of my wife\u2019s passing, I found myself experiencing tremendous guilt for feeling I was responsible for the crash.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168180216\" id=\"p_kkatz\">Robert blamed himself for not having had the plane inspected more thoroughly and for not giving his wife better instrument flying instructions.

Your wife forgives you. Your friends forgive you. I will lift your burden. \u2026\u2019<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168180296\" id=\"p_uLcTT\">\u201cFrom that moment, the burden of guilt [and despair] was amazingly lifted from me. I had been rescued!
