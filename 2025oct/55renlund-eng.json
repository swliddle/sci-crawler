A dinner was held on Temple Square June 15, 2018, where the announcement was made.                                               Dr. Craig H. Selzman, a heart surgery professor in the University of Utah\u2019s School of Medicine, is sitting with President Russell M. Nelson. Dr. Selzman is the recipient of the Dr. Russell M.

The announcement of the endowment was made June 15, 2018.\"/>\n<p data-aid=\"168182844\" id=\"p_vQGAC\">The first surgeon chosen to hold the professorship was Dr. Craig H. Selzman, a skilled heart surgeon who is not a member of our church. At the ceremony to award this professorship to Dr. Selzman, many important guests were in attendance, including President Nelson and his wife Sister Wendy W. Nelson. During the meeting, President Nelson spoke modestly of his pioneering surgical career.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"2\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168182845\" id=\"p_r6Sol\">Then Dr. Selzman shared what it meant to him to be appointed to this professorship. He related that four days earlier, after a long day in the operating room, he discovered that one of his patients needed to go back to surgery. He was tired and disappointed, knowing he would have to spend another night in the hospital.<\/p>\n<img alt=\"Dr. Selzman with Sister and President Nelson\" id=\"img_iJPPF\" src=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/y7862rwqxxkwzo0m2e277675j7zm9v9579a8p8jp/full/%21500%2C/0/default\" data-img-id=\"y7862rwqxxkwzo0m2e277675j7zm9v9579a8p8jp\" srcset=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/y7862rwqxxkwzo0m2e277675j7zm9v9579a8p8jp/full/%2160%2C/0/default 60w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/y7862rwqxxkwzo0m2e277675j7zm9v9579a8p8jp/full/%21100%2C/0/default 100w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/y7862rwqxxkwzo0m2e277675j7zm9v9579a8p8jp/full/%21200%2C/0/default 200w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/y7862rwqxxkwzo0m2e277675j7zm9v9579a8p8jp/full/%21250%2C/0/default 250w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/y7862rwqxxkwzo0m2e277675j7zm9v9579a8p8jp/full/%21320%2C/0/default 320w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/y7862rwqxxkwzo0m2e277675j7zm9v9579a8p8jp/full/%21500%2C/0/default 500w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/y7862rwqxxkwzo0m2e277675j7zm9v9579a8p8jp/full/%21640%2C/0/default 640w\" data-assetId=\"y7862rwqxxkwzo0m2e277675j7zm9v9579a8p8jp\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"281\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.7793594306049823\" data-public-title=\"President and Sister Nelson stand with Dr. Craig Selzman, Dr. Russell M.

Nelson Presidential Endowed Chair\"/>\n<p data-aid=\"168182846\" id=\"p_vnlI4\">This evening, Dr. Selzman had a life-changing conversation with himself. In the moment, he thought: \u201cOn Friday, I will be appointed to a professorship named after Dr. Nelson. He was always known as someone who kept his emotions in check, treated everyone with respect, and never lost his temper.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"3\"><\/sup><\/a> Now that my name will be linked with his, I need to try to be more like him.\u201d Dr. Selzman was already a very considerate surgeon. But he wanted to become even better.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168182847\" id=\"p_d34UF\">In the past, his surgical team might have been aware of his fatigue and frustration because he may have let it show in his manner and tone of voice. But in the operating room that night, Dr. Selzman made a conscientious effort to be especially supportive and understanding of his team. He felt it made a difference and resolved to continue trying to be more like Dr. Nelson.<\/p>\n<img alt=\"Dr. Selzman wearing RMN pin\" id=\"img_kifAn\" src=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/dq13p4r7hex3hbph9xnrlvg23j4lthnou9hpzy7n/full/%21500%2C/0/default\" data-img-id=\"dq13p4r7hex3hbph9xnrlvg23j4lthnou9hpzy7n\" srcset=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/dq13p4r7hex3hbph9xnrlvg23j4lthnou9hpzy7n/full/%2160%2C/0/default 60w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/dq13p4r7hex3hbph9xnrlvg23j4lthnou9hpzy7n/full/%21100%2C/0/default 100w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/dq13p4r7hex3hbph9xnrlvg23j4lthnou9hpzy7n/full/%21200%2C/0/default 200w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/dq13p4r7hex3hbph9xnrlvg23j4lthnou9hpzy7n/full/%21250%2C/0/default 250w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/dq13p4r7hex3hbph9xnrlvg23j4lthnou9hpzy7n/full/%21320%2C/0/default 320w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/dq13p4r7hex3hbph9xnrlvg23j4lthnou9hpzy7n/full/%21500%2C/0/default 500w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/dq13p4r7hex3hbph9xnrlvg23j4lthnou9hpzy7n/full/%21640%2C/0/default 640w\" data-assetId=\"dq13p4r7hex3hbph9xnrlvg23j4lthnou9hpzy7n\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"281\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.7793594306049823\" data-public-title=\"Dr. Craig Selzman, Dr. Russell M.

Referring to President Nelson\u2019s initials, RMN, he said, \u201cThere is an \u2018RMN\u2019 ethos that now pervades the Division of Cardiothoracic Surgery at the University of Utah.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"6\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168182849\" id=\"p_icRPA\">In frustrating situations, Dr. Selzman explained: \u201cI do what we now teach our trainees to do\u2014focus, get over it, and do the best you can. This ethos lives in us every day. We give lapel pins to every member of the division and each new trainee. At the bottom of the pin are the letters \u2018RMN.\u2019 The RMN ethos is foundational to our training; we teach it to everyone.\u201d Dr. Selzman had intentionally improved his prior attitude and aspirations because his name was now linked to that of President Nelson.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168182850\" id=\"p_nd6q2\">This series of events involving Dr. Selzman<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"7\"><\/sup><\/a> caused me to ask myself: \u201cHow have I changed since I linked my name with the name of Jesus Christ? Have I adopted a Christlike ethos as a result? Have I genuinely tried to become better and more like Him?\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168182851\" id=\"p_laDtG\">In Dr. Selzman\u2019s experience, we can see at least five parallels to the process through which we take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ. Even though that process begins with baptism, it is not complete until we are more pure and holy and have become more like Him.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"8\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168182852\" id=\"p_uxf5i\">The first parallel is identification. Dr. Selzman\u2019s appointment to the Nelson professorship linked his name to President Nelson\u2019s, and Dr. Selzman began to identify with President Nelson. When we take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ, we link our name with His. We identify with Him. We gladly become known as Christian. We acknowledge the Savior and unapologetically stand up to be counted as His.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"9\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168182853\" id=\"p_s5lrv\">Closely related to identification is another parallel\u2014remembrance. When Dr. Selzman goes into his office, his eyes are drawn to the medallion he received when he was appointed to the Nelson professorship. This medallion reminds him daily of the RMN ethos. For us, partaking of the sacrament each week helps us remember Jesus Christ throughout the week. As we partake of the sacrament, we do so in remembrance of the price He paid to redeem us. We covenant anew to remember Him, recognize His greatness, and appreciate His goodness. We acknowledge repeatedly that it is only in and through His grace that we are saved from physical and spiritual death.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"10\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168182854\" id=\"p_dmGzn\">Remembrance means that we follow the advice given by the Book of Mormon prophet Alma. We \u201clet all [our] doings be unto the Lord, and whithersoever [we go, we] let it be in the Lord; \u2026 [we] let all [our] thoughts be directed unto the Lord; \u2026 [and we] let the affections of [our hearts] be placed upon the Lord forever.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"11\"><\/sup><\/a> Even when we are occupied with other matters, we remain mindful of Him, just as we remember our own names, regardless of what else we focus on.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168182855\" id=\"p_xBFCB\">An outgrowth of remembering what the Savior has done for us is a third parallel\u2014emulation. Dr. Selzman began to emulate President Nelson and the RMN ethos. I believe that President Nelson\u2019s ethos is simply a manifestation of his lifelong discipleship of Jesus Christ.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"12\"><\/sup><\/a> For us, the more we identify with and remember Jesus Christ, the more we want to be like Him. As His disciples, we change for the better when we focus on Him, more so than when we focus on ourselves. We strive to become like Him and seek to be blessed with His attributes. We pray fervently to be filled with charity, the pure love of Christ.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"13\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168182856\" id=\"p_xKj9A\">As President Nelson taught in April: \u201cAs charity becomes part of our nature, we will lose the impulse to demean others. We will stop judging others. We will have charity for those from all walks of life. Charity towards all \u2026 is essential to our progress. Charity is the foundation of a godly character.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note14\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"14\"><\/sup><\/a> Alongside charity, we seek,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note15\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"15\"><\/sup><\/a> \u201ccultivate, \u2026 and expand\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note16\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"16\"><\/sup><\/a> other spiritual gifts from the Savior, including integrity, patience, and diligence.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note17\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"17\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168182857\" id=\"p_sFXUF\">Emulating Jesus Christ leads us to a fourth parallel\u2014alignment with His purposes. We join Him in His work. As a surgeon, Dr. Nelson was known as a teacher, a healer, and a researcher. The lapel pin used in Dr. Selzman\u2019s division emphasizes these endeavors, featuring the words <em>teach<\/em>, <em>heal<\/em>, and <em>discover<\/em>. For us, part of taking upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ involves willingly, intentionally, and enthusiastically aligning our goals with His.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note18\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"18\"><\/sup><\/a> We join Him in His work when we \u201clove, share, and invite.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note19\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"19\"><\/sup><\/a> We join Him in His work when we minister to others, especially the vulnerable and those who have been wounded, shattered, or crushed by their earthly experiences.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note20\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"20\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168182858\" id=\"p_hMmFY\">So we more fully take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ through identification, remembrance, emulation, and alignment.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note21\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"21\"><\/sup><\/a> Doing these four leads us to a fifth parallel\u2014empowerment. We access God\u2019s power and blessings in our lives. The Nelson professorship provides Dr. Selzman recognition and support funds that he is using to change the culture in his division. He applies this \u201cendowment of power\u201d to help others. In a similar way, when we take upon ourselves the name of the Savior, our Heavenly Father blesses us with His power to help us fulfill our mission in mortality.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168182859\" id=\"p_hQTjX\">As we make additional covenants with God, we take upon ourselves more fully the name of Jesus Christ.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note22\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"22\"><\/sup><\/a> Consequently, God blesses us with more of His power. As President Nelson taught: \u201cEach person who makes covenants in baptismal fonts and in temples\u2014and keeps them\u2014has <em>increased<\/em> access to the power of Jesus Christ. \u2026 The reward for keeping covenants with God is heavenly power \u2026 that strengthens us to withstand our trials, temptations, and heartaches <em>better<\/em>.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note23\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"23\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168182860\" id=\"p_vtunk\">We become <em>more<\/em> spiritually receptive. We have <em>more<\/em> courage to confront seemingly impossible circumstances. We are strengthened <em>more<\/em> in our resolve to follow Jesus Christ. We <em>more<\/em> speedily repent and return to Him when we transgress.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note24\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"24\"><\/sup><\/a> We become <em>better<\/em> at sharing His gospel with His power and authority. We help those in need while being less judgmental, far less judgmental. We retain a remission of our sins. We have greater peace, and we are more cheerful because we can always rejoice.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note25\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"25\"><\/sup><\/a> His glory will be round about us, and His angels will have charge over us.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note26\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"26\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168182861\" id=\"p_m2ifA\">The Savior invites us, \u201cCome unto the Father in my name, and in due time receive of his fulness.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note27\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"27\"><\/sup><\/a> I urge you to do this. Come unto our Heavenly Father. Take upon yourself the name of Jesus Christ. Identify with Him. Always remember Him. Strive to be like Him. Join Him in His work. Receive His power and blessings in your life.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note28\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"28\"><\/sup><\/a> Etch His name in your heart, willingly and intentionally. This gives you \u201cstanding\u201d before God<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note29\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"29\"><\/sup><\/a> and qualifies you for the Savior\u2019s advocacy on your behalf.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note30\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"30\"><\/sup><\/a> You will become an exalted inheritor in the kingdom of our Father in Heaven, a joint-heir with His Firstborn, our beloved Savior and Redeemer.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note31\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"31\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168182862\" id=\"p_jY6Wx\">He lives.
