It took place at the USA Masters Track and Field National Championship\u2014a competition for seniors.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179216\" id=\"p_rJ50O\">One of the participants in the 1,500-meter event was 100-year-old Orville Rogers. The author writes:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179220\" id=\"p_b9Cjd\">\u201cWhen the starter pistol fired, the runners took off, with Orville settling immediately into last place, where he remained alone for the entire race, shuffling along very slowly. [When] the last runner besides Orville finished, Orville still had two and a half laps to go. Nearly 3,000 spectators sat quietly watching him slowly make his way around the track\u2014completely, silently, and uncomfortably alone.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179222\" id=\"p_xwxmx\">\u201c[But] when he began his final lap, the crowd rose to their feet, cheering and applauding. By the time he hit the homestretch, the crowd was roaring. With the cheering encouragement of thousands of spectators, Orville called on his last reserves of energy. The crowd erupted with delight as he crossed the finish line and was embraced by his competitors. Orville humbly and gratefully waved to the crowd and walked off the track with his new friends.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"1\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179223\" id=\"p_wpg8e\">This was Orville\u2019s <em>fifth<\/em> race of the competition, and in each of the other events, he had <em>also<\/em> taken last place. Some might have been tempted to judge Orville, thinking that he shouldn\u2019t have even competed at his age\u2014that he didn\u2019t belong on the track because he greatly prolonged <em>his<\/em> events for everyone else.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179228\" id=\"p_byRi5\">But even though he always finished last, Orville broke five world records that day. No one watching him race would have believed that possible, but neither the spectators nor his competitors were the judges. Orville didn\u2019t break any rules, and the officials didn\u2019t lower any standards. He ran the same race and fulfilled the same requirements as all the other competitors. But his degree of difficulty\u2014in this case, his age and limited physical capacity\u2014was factored in by placing him in the 100-plus age division. And in <em>that<\/em> division, he broke five world records.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179234\" id=\"p_mwyOI\">Just as it took Orville great courage to step out on that track each time, it also takes great courage for some of our sisters and brothers to step into the arena of life every day, knowing they may be judged unfairly even though they\u2019re doing the best they can against daunting odds to follow the Savior and honor their covenants with Him.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179237\" id=\"p_d1e44\">No matter where we live in the world, no matter our age, it is a basic human need for <em>all<\/em> of us to feel a sense of belonging, to feel that we are wanted and needed and that our lives have purpose and meaning, no matter our circumstances or limitations.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"2\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179239\" id=\"p_z5hBe\">On the last lap of the race, the crowd overwhelmingly cheered Orville on, giving him the strength to keep going. It didn\u2019t matter that he finished last. For the participants and the crowd, this was about far more than a competition. In many ways, this was a beautiful example of the Savior\u2019s love in action. When Orville finished, they all rejoiced together.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"3\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179244\" id=\"p_qrLp4\">Just like the Masters Championship, our congregations and families can be gathering places where we cheer each other on\u2014covenant communities fueled by the love of Christ for one another\u2014helping each other overcome whatever challenges we face, giving each other strength and encouragement without judging one another. We <em>need<\/em> each other. Divine strength comes from unity,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"4\"><\/sup><\/a> and that is why Satan is intent on dividing us.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"5\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179247\" id=\"p_fpVqw\">Unfortunately, for some of us, attending church can be hard at times for many different reasons. It could be someone struggling with questions of faith or someone with social anxiety or depression. It could be someone from a different country or race or someone with different life experiences or ways of seeing things who may feel they don\u2019t fit the mold. It could even be sleep-deprived and emotionally stretched parents of babies and young children or someone who is single in a congregation full of couples and families. It could also be someone mustering the courage to return after years of being away or someone with a nagging feeling that they just don\u2019t measure up and will never belong.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179253\" id=\"p_kLOdZ\">President Russell M. Nelson said: \u201cIf a couple in your ward gets divorced, or a young missionary returns home early, or a teenager doubts his testimony, they do not need your judgment. They need to experience the pure love of Jesus Christ reflected in your words and actions.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"6\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179255\" id=\"p_rVCCN\">Our experience at church is meant to provide vital connections with the Lord and with each other that are so needed for our spiritual and emotional well-being. Inherent in the covenants we make with God, beginning with baptism, is our responsibility to love and care for each other<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"7\"><\/sup><\/a> as members of the family of God, members of the body of Christ,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"8\"><\/sup><\/a> and not just to check off a box on a list of things we\u2019re expected to do.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179260\" id=\"p_w32D0\">Christlike love and care are higher and holier. The pure love of Christ is charity.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"9\"><\/sup><\/a> As President Nelson taught, \u201cCharity propels us \u2018to bear one another\u2019s burdens\u2019 [<a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/18?lang=eng&amp;id=p8#p8\">Mosiah 18:8<\/a>] rather than <em>heap<\/em> burdens <em>upon<\/em> each other.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"10\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179265\" id=\"p_fy0Ka\">The Savior said, \u201cBy <em>this<\/em> shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"11\"><\/sup><\/a> And President Nelson added: \u201cCharity is the principal characteristic of a true follower of Jesus Christ.\u201d \u201cThe Savior\u2019s message is clear: His <em>true<\/em> disciples build, lift, encourage, persuade, and inspire. \u2026 How we speak to and about others \u2026 really matters.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"12\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179268\" id=\"p_aeNmD\">The Savior\u2019s teaching on this is very simple. It\u2019s summed up in the Golden Rule: Do unto others as you would have others do unto you.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"13\"><\/sup><\/a> Put yourself in that person\u2019s place and treat them the way <em>you<\/em> would want to be treated if you were in <em>their<\/em> shoes.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note14\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"14\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179272\" id=\"p_biyIU\">Christlike treatment of others goes <em>far<\/em> beyond our families and congregations. It includes our sisters and brothers of other faiths or no faith at all. It includes our brothers and sisters from other countries and cultures, as well as those of different political persuasions. We are <em>all<\/em> part of the family of God, and He loves <em>all<\/em> His children.
