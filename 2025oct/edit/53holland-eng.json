Holland<\/p>\n<p class=\"author-role\" data-aid=\"168179774\" id=\"p_pyj5x\">Of the Seventy<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"kicker\" data-aid=\"168179788\" id=\"p_qXFdI\">You have immediate access to divine help and healing despite your human flaws.<\/p>\n<\/header>\n<div class=\"body-block\">\n<p data-aid=\"168179802\" id=\"p_iApJs\">A schoolteacher once taught that a whale\u2014even though large\u2014could not swallow a human because whales have small throats. A girl objected, \u201cBut Jonah was swallowed by a whale.\u201d The teacher responded, \u201cThat\u2019s impossible.\u201d Still not convinced, the girl said, \u201cWell, when I get to heaven, I will ask him.\u201d The teacher sneered, \u201cWhat if Jonah was a sinner and didn\u2019t go to heaven?\u201d The girl replied, \u201cThen you can ask him.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179816\" id=\"p_s79rC\">We laugh, but we should not miss the power Jonah\u2019s story offers every \u201chumble seeker of happiness,\u201d especially those struggling.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"1\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179830\" id=\"p_vlLFm\">God commanded Jonah to \u201cgo to Nineveh\u201d to declare repentance. But Nineveh was ancient Israel\u2019s brutal enemy\u2014so Jonah promptly heads the exact opposite direction, by boat, to Tarshish.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"2\"><\/sup><\/a> As he sails away from his calling, a ship-wrecking storm develops. Certain his disobedience is the cause, Jonah volunteers to be thrown overboard. This calms the raging sea, which saves his shipmates.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179845\" id=\"p_s5tRl\">Miraculously, Jonah escapes death when a \u201cgreat fish\u201d the Lord \u201cprepared\u201d swallows him. But he languishes in that unbelievably dark and putrid place for three days, until he\u2019s finally spit out on dry ground. He then accepts his call to Nineveh. Yet, when the city repents and is spared destruction, Jonah resents the mercy shown his enemies. God patiently teaches Jonah that He loves and seeks to rescue all His children.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"3\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179856\" id=\"p_sbuSz\">Stumbling more than once in his duties, Jonah provides a vivid testimony that in mortality, \u201call are fallen.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"4\"><\/sup><\/a> We don\u2019t often speak of a testimony of the Fall. But having a doctrinal understanding and spiritual witness of why every single one of us struggles with moral, physical, and situational challenges is a great blessing. Here on earth, ugly weeds grow, even strong bones break, and <em>all<\/em> \u201ccome short of the glory of God.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"5\"><\/sup><\/a> But this mortal condition\u2014a result of choices made by Adam and Eve\u2014is essential to the very reason we exist: \u201cthat [we] might have joy\u201d! As our first parents learned, only by tasting the bitterness and feeling the pain of a fallen world could we even conceive of, let alone enjoy, true happiness.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"6\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179870\" id=\"p_gdJkH\">A testimony of the Fall does <em>not<\/em> excuse sin or a lax approach in life\u2019s duties, which <em>always<\/em> call for diligence, virtue, and accountability. But it should temper our frustrations when things just go wrong or we see a moral failing in a family member, friend, or leader. Too often things like this cause us to wallow in contentious criticism or resentment that robs our faith. But a firm testimony of the Fall can help us be more like God as described by Jonah, that is, \u201cmerciful, slow to anger, and of great kindness\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"7\"><\/sup><\/a> to all\u2014including ourselves\u2014in our unavoidably imperfect state.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179884\" id=\"p_nU9Dw\">Even greater than manifesting the effects of the Fall, Jonah\u2019s story powerfully directs us to Him who can deliver us from those effects. Jonah\u2019s self-sacrifice to save his shipmates is Christlike indeed. And three times when Jesus is pressed for a miraculous sign of His divinity, He thunders that \u201cthere shall no sign be given \u2026 but the sign of Jonas [Jonah],\u201d declaring that as Jonah was \u201cthree days and three nights in the whale\u2019s belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"8\"><\/sup><\/a> As a symbol of the Savior\u2019s sacrificial death and glorious Resurrection, Jonah may be flawed. But this is also what makes his personal witness of and commitment to Jesus Christ, offered in the belly of the whale, so poignant and inspiring.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"9\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179897\" id=\"p_tR4M0\">Jonah\u2019s cry is that of a good man in crisis, one largely of his own making.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"10\"><\/sup><\/a> For a saint, when catastrophe is brought on by a regrettable habit, comment, or decision, despite so many other good intentions and earnest efforts of righteousness, it can be especially crushing and leave one feeling forsaken.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"11\"><\/sup><\/a> But whatever the cause or degree of disaster we face, there is <em>always<\/em> dry ground for hope, healing, and happiness. Listen to Jonah:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179908\" id=\"p_mzHzn\">\u201cI cried by reason of mine affliction unto the Lord \u2026 ; out of the belly of hell cried I. \u2026<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179921\" id=\"p_kJttA\">\u201cFor thou hadst cast me into the deep, in the midst of the seas; \u2026<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179934\" id=\"p_rD8lR\">\u201c[And] I said, I am cast out of thy sight; <em>yet<\/em> I will look again toward thy holy temple.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179947\" id=\"p_llYst\">\u201cThe waters compassed me about, <em>even<\/em> to the soul: the depth closed me round about, the weeds were wrapped about my head.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179960\" id=\"p_gVv7U\">\u201cI went down to the bottoms of the mountains; \u2026 <em>yet<\/em> hast thou brought up my life from corruption. \u2026<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179973\" id=\"p_u28fb\">\u201cWhen my soul fainted \u2026 I remembered the Lord: and my prayer came \u2026 into thine holy temple.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179986\" id=\"p_qdeA8\">\u201cThey that observe lying vanities <em>forsake their own mercy<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179999\" id=\"p_c3Ykl\">\u201cBut I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving; I will <em>pay that that I have vowed<\/em>. Salvation is of the Lord.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"12\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168180012\" id=\"p_hU04K\">Though it was many years ago, I can tell you exactly where I was sitting and exactly what I was feeling when, deep in the belly of a personal hell, I discovered this scripture. For anyone today feeling like I did then\u2014that you are cast off, sinking in deepest waters, with seaweed wrapped about your head and oceanic mountains crashing all around you\u2014my plea, inspired by Jonah, is <em>forsake not your own mercy<\/em>. You have immediate access to divine help and healing despite your human flaws. This awe-inspiring mercy comes in and through Jesus Christ. Because He knows and loves you perfectly, He offers it to you as your \u201c<em>own<\/em>,\u201d meaning it is perfectly suited to you, designed to relieve <em>your<\/em> individual agonies and heal <em>your<\/em> particular pains. So, for heaven\u2019s sake and yours, do not turn your back on that. Accept it. Start by refusing to listen to the \u201clying vanities\u201d of the adversary, who would tempt you into thinking that relief is found in sailing away from your spiritual responsibilities. Instead, follow the lead of the repentant Jonah. Cry unto God. Turn to the temple. Cling to your covenants. Serve the Lord, His Church, and others with sacrifice and thanksgiving.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168180025\" id=\"p_gsa2z\">Doing these things brings a vision of God\u2019s special covenantal love for you\u2014what the Hebrew Bible calls <em>hesed<\/em>. You will see and feel the power of God\u2019s loyal, untiring, inexhaustible, and \u201ctender mercies\u201d that can make you \u201cmighty \u2026 unto \u2026 deliverance\u201d from any sin or any setback.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"13\"><\/sup><\/a> Early and intense anguish may cloud that vision at first. But as you continue to \u201c<em>pay that that [you] have vowed<\/em>,\u201d such a vision will shine brighter and brighter in your soul. And with that vision you will not only find hope and healing, but, astonishingly, you will find joy, even in the midst of your crucible. President Russell M. Nelson taught us so very well: \u201cWhen the focus of our lives is on God\u2019s plan of salvation \u2026 and Jesus Christ and His gospel, we can feel joy regardless of what is happening\u2014or not happening\u2014in our lives. Joy comes from and because of Him.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note14\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"14\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168180038\" id=\"p_azWGz\">Whether we are facing a deep, Jonah-like catastrophe or the everyday challenges of our imperfect world, the invitation is the same: Forsake not your own mercy. Look to the sign of Jonah, the living Christ, He who rose from His three-day grave having conquered <em>all<\/em>\u2014<em>for you<\/em>. Turn to Him. Believe in Him. Serve Him. Smile. For in Him, and Him alone, is found the full and happy healing from the Fall, healing we all so urgently need and humbly seek. I testify this is true. In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<footer class=\"notes\">\n<p class=\"title\" data-aid=\"168180052\" id=\"p_dHjaw\">Notes<\/p>\n<ol class=\"decimal\" data-type=\"marker\" start=\"1\">\n<li data-marker=\"1.\" id=\"note1\" data-full-marker=\"1.\">\n<p data-aid=\"168180066\" id=\"p_xyhxc\"><a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/27?lang=eng&amp;id=p18#p18\">Alma 27:18<\/a>.
