Barcellos<\/p>\n<p class=\"author-role\" data-aid=\"168179003\" id=\"p_x4uIa\">Of the Seventy<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"kicker\" data-aid=\"168179005\" id=\"p_tmy3N\">All God needs to accomplish His purposes and to help us become who He wants is for each of us to turn our hearts fully to Him.<\/p>\n<\/header>\n<div class=\"body-block\">\n<p data-aid=\"168179009\" id=\"p_bE2wk\">When commanded to choose the new king of Israel from among the sons of Jesse, the prophet Samuel, upon looking at Jesse\u2019s oldest son, Eliab, exclaimed with enthusiasm, \u201cSurely the Lord\u2019s anointed is before him.\u201d But Eliab was not the Lord\u2019s chosen servant. The Savior warned Samuel: \u201cLook not on his countenance, or on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for the Lord seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the outward appearance, but the Lord looketh on the heart.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"1\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179011\" id=\"p_bcAz4\">While David may not have been physically the strongest or most skilled of his brothers, his heart was strong in the sight of God. He loved God with all his heart and had a deep desire to obey Him. He had unwavering faith in God\u2019s love, power, and promised blessings, as he later demonstrated when he fearlessly fought and defeated Goliath with the Lord\u2019s help.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179014\" id=\"p_eXeuU\">This story teaches us that all God needs to accomplish His purposes and to help us become who He wants us to become is for each of us to turn our hearts fully to Him. To a lawyer, He commanded, \u201cThou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"2\"><\/sup><\/a> To the Prophet Joseph Smith, He said, \u201cBehold, the Lord requireth the heart and a willing mind.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"3\"><\/sup><\/a> And to the Nephites, the resurrected Savior extended this invitation: \u201cYe shall offer for a sacrifice unto me a broken heart and a contrite spirit.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"4\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179018\" id=\"p_hIPM4\">Why is that so? The Savior taught that if our hearts are fully turned to Him, because of His atoning sacrifice we can be blessed with the strength and spiritual gifts we need to overcome our mortal challenges, resist temptation, receive direction and understanding, and feel joy and peace in our lives. \u201cOut of small things proceedeth that which is great.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"5\"><\/sup><\/a> He said He can \u201cmake weak things become strong\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"6\"><\/sup><\/a> and bless us with everything we need to succeed in this mortal life and to receive eternal life. \u201cBlessed are the pure in heart,\u201d He said, \u201cfor they shall see God.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"7\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179020\" id=\"p_qaa1k\">I believe this is why, at least in part, Jesus Christ so often corrected the scribes and Pharisees during His mortal ministry. Though diligent in keeping His law, they did so for the wrong reasons.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"8\"><\/sup><\/a> He rebuked them, saying, \u201cThis people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"9\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179023\" id=\"p_p8jJ2\">This is a sober reminder to all His disciples that it is not just about what we do\u2014our words and actions\u2014but also why we do what Jesus Christ has asked us to do\u2014our desires and motives. He said, \u201cFor I, the Lord, will judge all men according to their works, according to the desire of their hearts.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"10\"><\/sup><\/a> Our Heavenly Father desires more than mechanical acts of obedience and service from His children. He wants us to do those things with real intent because we love Him with all our hearts. He wants us to desire to become like Him.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179027\" id=\"p_dUmYU\">Now, if the spiritual health of our hearts is a main concern of the Savior\u2014what He looks for in a true disciple\u2014how can we examine our heart and know if it is right in the sight of God?<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179030\" id=\"p_xewEV\">Recently, as my wife and I returned from our mission in Portugal, we ran a series of health tests to evaluate our physical condition. Some of those tests focused on our hearts\u2019 health\u2014such as blood tests, echocardiograms, and stress tests. I believe the Savior has also provided us with a set of spiritual tests we can use to assess our hearts\u2019 spiritual condition. Let me share a few with you.<\/p>\n<section id=\"sec_pCjiC\">\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"168179032\" id=\"p_ike0X\">Assessing Your Heart with Spiritual Tests<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h3 data-aid=\"168179035\" id=\"p_hJcu3\">First, Our Focus,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"11\"><\/sup><\/a> Priorities, and Motives<\/h3>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"168179038\" id=\"p_zy6P1\">\u201cFor where your treasure is, there will your heart be also,\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"12\"><\/sup><\/a> Jesus taught. A treasure is something precious to us, something to which we dedicate effort and attention. Where we choose to spend our time and focus our attention, as well as what motivates us to do what we do, says a lot about our hearts. The Savior warned that while many are called by Him, few are chosen \u201cbecause their hearts are set so much upon the things of this world, and [they] aspire to the honors of men.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"13\"><\/sup><\/a> Do I make the Savior a priority in my life?

Nephi exhorted his brothers, saying: \u201cHow is it that ye do not keep the commandments of the Lord? How is it that ye will perish, because of the hardness of your hearts?\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note14\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"14\"><\/sup><\/a> To the Saints in Missouri, the Lord warned, \u201cBut he that doeth not anything until he is commanded, and receiveth a commandment with doubtful heart, and keepeth it with slothfulness, the same is damned.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note15\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"15\"><\/sup><\/a> While the Savior does not expect perfection in keeping His commandments, He does ask that we desire and strive to keep them with all our hearts.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"sec_fhmSo\">\n<header>\n<h3 data-aid=\"168179047\" id=\"p_s1Ah8\">Third, Our Diligence in Studying the Scriptures and Seeking Revelation<\/h3>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"168179049\" id=\"p_kqYzI\">The Lord admonished Oliver Cowdery to \u201ctreasure up these words in thy heart.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note16\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"16\"><\/sup><\/a> We\u2019re invited to search the scriptures diligently and, through the power of the Holy Ghost, seek to obtain understanding and a witness of the truthfulness of the gospel in our hearts.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179052\" id=\"p_tkOaQ\">The prophet Abinadi rebuked the priests of the wicked King Noah for not doing that, saying, \u201cYe have not applied your hearts to understanding; therefore, ye have not been wise.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note17\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"17\"><\/sup><\/a> Am I making a sincere effort to study the scriptures daily and to apply my heart to understand them through prayer?<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"sec_oGtYF\">\n<header>\n<h3 data-aid=\"168179056\" id=\"p_eyOtv\">Fourth, Our Thoughts and Words<\/h3>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"168179059\" id=\"p_o4kcK\">The Savior taught that \u201cout of the heart proceed evil thoughts\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note18\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"18\"><\/sup><\/a> and that \u201cout of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note19\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"19\"><\/sup><\/a> The quality of our thoughts and words is a good indicator of the purity of our hearts. Am I fostering too many negative thoughts about others\u2019 actions or motives, or even about myself? Am I too quick to judge and condemn others? Do I seek to find excuses or justification for my mistakes? And what about my words? Do they lift and inspire those around me?
