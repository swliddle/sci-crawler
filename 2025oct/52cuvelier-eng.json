Nelson taught that if the Lord were speaking to us directly, the first thing He would make sure we understand is our true identity: we are children of God, children of the covenant, and disciples of Jesus Christ. Any other designation will ultimately let us down.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"1\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179814\" id=\"p_leb1u\">I learned this for myself when my oldest son received his first cell phone. With great excitement, he began entering the names of his family and friends into his contacts. One day I noticed his mom was calling. On the screen appeared the name \u201cMother.\u201d That was a sensible and dignified choice\u2014and, I\u2019ll admit, a sign of respect for the better parent in our home. Naturally, I got curious. What name had he given me?<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179828\" id=\"p_ky0bd\">I scrolled through his contacts, assuming that if Wendi was \u201cMother,\u201d I must be \u201cFather.\u201d Not there. I searched for \u201cDad.\u201d Still nothing. My curiosity turned into mild concern. \u201cDoes he call me \u2018Corey\u2019?\u201d No. In a last-ditch effort, I thought, \u201cWe\u2019re soccer players\u2014maybe he calls me \u2018Pelé.\u2019\u201d Wishful thinking. Finally, I called his number myself, and two words popped up on his screen: \u201cNot Mother\u201d!<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179835\" id=\"p_sKoiG\">Brothers and sisters, by which name are you called?<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179857\" id=\"p_y3m5T\">Jesus called His followers by many names: Disciples.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"2\"><\/sup><\/a> Sons and daughters.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"3\"><\/sup><\/a> Children of the prophets.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"4\"><\/sup><\/a> Sheep.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"5\"><\/sup><\/a> Friends.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"6\"><\/sup><\/a> The light of the world.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"7\"><\/sup><\/a> Saints.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"8\"><\/sup><\/a> Each carries eternal significance and underscores a personal relationship with the Savior.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179871\" id=\"p_rr5wQ\">But among these names, one rises above the rest\u2014the name of Christ. In the Book of Mormon, King Benjamin powerfully taught:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179885\" id=\"p_pyzA1\">\u201cThere is no other name given whereby salvation cometh; therefore, I would that ye should take upon you the name of Christ. \u2026<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179898\" id=\"p_aWXK0\">\u201cAnd it shall come to pass that whosoever doeth this shall be found at the right hand of God, for he shall know the name by which he is called; for he shall be called by the name of Christ.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"9\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179911\" id=\"p_iiOLK\">Those who take upon themselves the name of Christ become His disciples and witnesses. In the book of Acts, we read that after the Resurrection of Jesus Christ, chosen witnesses were commanded to testify that whosoever believed in Jesus, was baptized, and received the Holy Ghost would receive a remission of sins.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"10\"><\/sup><\/a> Those who received these sacred ordinances assembled with the Church, became disciples, and were called Christians.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"11\"><\/sup><\/a> The Book of Mormon also describes believers in Christ as Christians<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"12\"><\/sup><\/a> and covenant people as \u201cthe children of Christ, his sons, and his daughters.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"13\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179924\" id=\"p_zoC0s\">What does it mean to be called by the name of Christ?

My great-grandfather Martin Gassner was changed forever because a humble branch president answered the Savior\u2019s call. In Germany in 1909, times were tough and money was tight. Martin worked as a welder in a pipe manufacturing plant. By his own admission, most paydays ended in drinking, smoking, and buying rounds at the pub. His wife finally warned him that if he didn\u2019t change, she would leave.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179963\" id=\"p_iqipK\">One day, Martin\u2019s coworker met him on the way to the pub with a crumpled religious booklet in his hand. He had found it on the street and told Martin that he felt something different after reading the pamphlet entitled <em>Was wissen Sie von den Mormonen?<\/em>, or <em>What Do You Know About the Mormons?<\/em> I\u2019m certain that title has changed.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179976\" id=\"p_ifdfU\">An address stamped on the back was just legible enough to decipher where the church was located. It was a considerable distance away, but they were moved by what they read and decided to take the train that Sunday to investigate. When they arrived, they found that the address was not the church they expected but a funeral home. Martin hesitated\u2014because, really, a church in a funeral home sounded a little too much like a package deal.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179989\" id=\"p_doYNu\">But upstairs, in a rented hall, they found a small group of Saints. A man invited them to testimony meeting. Martin was touched by the Spirit and was so impressed by the simple, fervent testimonies that he bore his testimony. And it was there, in that most unlikely place, that he said he already knew it must be true.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168180002\" id=\"p_jmw7n\">Afterward the man introduced himself as the branch president and asked if they would return. Martin explained that he lived too far away and couldn\u2019t afford the weekly trip. The branch president simply said, \u201cFollow me.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168180015\" id=\"p_m7RA1\">They walked a few blocks to a nearby factory where the branch president\u2019s friend worked. After a short conversation, Martin and his friend were both offered jobs. Then the branch president led them to an apartment building and secured housing for their families.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168180028\" id=\"p_oRHEg\">All of this happened within two hours. Martin\u2019s family moved the following week. Six months later they were baptized. The man once known as a hopeless drunk became so ardent in his new faith that people in town began calling him, perhaps not so affectionately, \u201cthe priest.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168180041\" id=\"p_aOYhw\">As for the branch president, I cannot tell you his name\u2014his identity has been lost to time. But I call him a disciple, ambassador,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note25\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"25\"><\/sup><\/a> Christian, good Samaritan,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note26\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"26\"><\/sup><\/a> and friend. His influence is still felt 116 years later, and I stand on the shoulders of his discipleship.<\/p>\n<img alt=\"Gassners at the temple\" id=\"img_aOxT3\" src=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/gqc6bv8b2ut2hh8esr517usazthphyhafok32pn2/full/%21500%2C/0/default\" data-img-id=\"gqc6bv8b2ut2hh8esr517usazthphyhafok32pn2\" srcset=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/gqc6bv8b2ut2hh8esr517usazthphyhafok32pn2/full/%2160%2C/0/default 60w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/gqc6bv8b2ut2hh8esr517usazthphyhafok32pn2/full/%21100%2C/0/default 100w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/gqc6bv8b2ut2hh8esr517usazthphyhafok32pn2/full/%21200%2C/0/default 200w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/gqc6bv8b2ut2hh8esr517usazthphyhafok32pn2/full/%21250%2C/0/default 250w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/gqc6bv8b2ut2hh8esr517usazthphyhafok32pn2/full/%21320%2C/0/default 320w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/gqc6bv8b2ut2hh8esr517usazthphyhafok32pn2/full/%21500%2C/0/default 500w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/gqc6bv8b2ut2hh8esr517usazthphyhafok32pn2/full/%21640%2C/0/default 640w\" data-assetId=\"gqc6bv8b2ut2hh8esr517usazthphyhafok32pn2\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"375\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.3333333333333333\" data-public-title=\"Elder Cuvelier's relatives outside of the Bern, Switzerland temple after being sealed together\" data-public-description=\"Elder Cuvelier's relatives outside of the Bern, Switzerland temple after being sealed together\"/>\n<p data-aid=\"168180056\" id=\"p_kCa1L\">\u201cThere is a saying that you can count the seeds in an apple, but you can\u2019t count the apples that come from one seed.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note27\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"27\"><\/sup><\/a> The seed planted by the branch president has produced countless fruit.

In fact, He did so much that His disciples couldn\u2019t write it all down. The Apostle John recorded, \u201cThere are also many other things which Jesus did, the which, if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that should be written.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note31\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"31\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168180113\" id=\"p_wIpea\">Let us strive to follow Christ\u2019s example, doing good and making discipleship a lifelong priority so that each time we interact with others, they will feel God\u2019s love and the confirming power of the Holy Ghost.
