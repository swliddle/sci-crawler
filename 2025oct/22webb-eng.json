Near the end of the course, the professor announced that students could bring to the final exam one piece of paper on which they could place anything they wanted. Some students prepared by making tiny notes with information from lectures and textbooks, readable only by using a magnifying glass. But the young man arrived at the final exam with a blank sheet of paper and a stranger. When the professor questioned him, the young man replied, \u201cYou said I could bring one piece of paper with anything on it.\u201d He then placed the paper on the floor next to his desk and said, \u201cI\u2019d like my tutor to stand on my piece of paper.\u201d<\/p>\n<section id=\"sec_lyoCm\">\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"168179506\" id=\"p_jEY6P\">The Holy Ghost<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"168179512\" id=\"p_pZYBW\">As members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, blessed with the companionship of a member of the Godhead, we can have the help of the perfect Tutor.

But even more effective is when we, as learners, also come prepared and when teachers create learning experiences that foster personal revelation directly to our hearts and minds. Then, as we\u2019re given opportunities to share what we are learning through our study and from the Holy Ghost,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"8\"><\/sup><\/a> we help each other to be instructed and edified.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"9\"><\/sup><\/a> As we apply gospel principles, the Spirit again bears witness of their truthfulness.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"10\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<img alt=\"Opportunities to share\" id=\"img_o8AaX\" src=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/u6hqnulh65789gyfmj56w514hnbqjlxnwjsy6qcj/full/%21500%2C/0/default\" data-img-id=\"u6hqnulh65789gyfmj56w514hnbqjlxnwjsy6qcj\" srcset=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/u6hqnulh65789gyfmj56w514hnbqjlxnwjsy6qcj/full/%2160%2C/0/default 60w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/u6hqnulh65789gyfmj56w514hnbqjlxnwjsy6qcj/full/%21100%2C/0/default 100w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/u6hqnulh65789gyfmj56w514hnbqjlxnwjsy6qcj/full/%21200%2C/0/default 200w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/u6hqnulh65789gyfmj56w514hnbqjlxnwjsy6qcj/full/%21250%2C/0/default 250w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/u6hqnulh65789gyfmj56w514hnbqjlxnwjsy6qcj/full/%21320%2C/0/default 320w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/u6hqnulh65789gyfmj56w514hnbqjlxnwjsy6qcj/full/%21500%2C/0/default 500w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/u6hqnulh65789gyfmj56w514hnbqjlxnwjsy6qcj/full/%21640%2C/0/default 640w\" data-assetId=\"u6hqnulh65789gyfmj56w514hnbqjlxnwjsy6qcj\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"281\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.7793594306049823\" data-public-title=\"Chad H.

When I began college, I mistakenly thought of school as something to endure in order to be allowed to play sports. One day, after reading a paper I had written, my professor told me she thought I was a gifted analytical thinker. I didn\u2019t even know what that meant. She said that with more focused effort, I could be a good student. That thought had never crossed my mind.

Imagine Adam and Eve, Abinadi, or even the Master Teacher, Jesus Christ, visiting our homes or classes to teach us. They can when we feast upon the word of God.

As she prayed for guidance, an impression came that she should attend institute, so she enrolled in a New Testament class. The way her institute teacher taught from the scriptures, even the way he held them, showed how much he loved the word of God. As she attended, the Holy Ghost whispered to her that there was something in the scriptures that she needed. Her teacher\u2019s love for the scriptures and the promptings of the Holy Ghost gave her a desire to begin a serious study of the word of God\u2014which became a lifelong journey of deep conversion and consecrated service.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"sec_zYREf\">\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"168179581\" id=\"p_nRbSF\">Focus on Jesus Christ<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"168179589\" id=\"p_hJPtA\">Finally, as <cite>Teaching in the Savior\u2019s Way<\/cite> suggests, our teaching and learning should always focus on Jesus Christ.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note26\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"26\"><\/sup><\/a> We can speak more often and more reverently of Him and seek more opportunities to express testimony, gratitude, and love for Him. Whatever the setting, as we remember Him, we can have \u201chis Spirit to be with [us].\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note27\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"27\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179599\" id=\"p_otGPC\">One way to place Jesus Christ at the center of our teaching is to emphasize that He is the perfect example, the embodiment and expression of all gospel principles.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note28\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"28\"><\/sup><\/a> Even when He is not directly referred to in a scriptural account, we can still point to Him as the example of the principle being taught. We might simply ask, \u201cCan you think of a time when Jesus Christ exemplified this principle?\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179605\" id=\"p_hgCV4\">We can also focus on Him by learning of His titles, roles, and attributes, seeking not only to learn what He has done but also to better understand who He is. For example, when studying the principle of repentance, it\u2019s important to understand how to repent. But it\u2019s also essential to remember what Jesus Christ has done to make repentance possible and to understand what repentance teaches us about Him, about His true nature and characteristics. What does our opportunity to repent say about His love, patience, and mercy, His belief in our divine potential, His willingness to atone for our sins, and the joy He finds in forgiving? And understanding His titles\u2014such as Lamb of God, Redeemer, and Physician\u2014helps us see that repentance is His invitation to cleanse, change, and heal us.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note29\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"29\"><\/sup><\/a> Focusing on what He has done for us and what it says about who He is can help us have \u201cfaith unto repentance.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note30\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"30\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179613\" id=\"p_d0Ycj\">At times, we may not immediately see the attributes of the Savior outlined in a scriptural account. For example, when reading about Nephi building a boat, we might focus only on Nephi. But focusing on the Savior can help us see that this record was not preserved to teach us about the greatness of Nephi but to show us the greatness of God\u2014that He gives us strength to keep His commandments<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note31\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"31\"><\/sup><\/a> and delivers us in times of need.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note32\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"32\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179622\" id=\"p_lt4OM\">We can also focus on Jesus Christ\u2019s central role in Heavenly Father\u2019s perfect plan of happiness. It can change the course of our lives to see our circumstances through the lens of God\u2019s eternal plan instead of seeing the plan through the lens of our temporal circumstances. The gospel is not a list of demands; it\u2019s the good news that Jesus Christ overcame sin and death.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note33\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"33\"><\/sup><\/a> It is by accessing His amazing grace through keeping our covenants with God that we can live joyfully now and prepare for life with our Father in Heaven in the eternities. As we learn to see Heavenly Father and the Savior in the scriptures, we will come to know Them better and we will see Their love and influence more frequently and more powerfully in our own lives.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179632\" id=\"p_hGHkv\">I will always remember the Spirit I felt as a youth when our teacher taught about the final days of the Savior\u2019s life. He helped us see the significance of the events in the upper room, Gethsemane, Golgotha, and the empty tomb. He shared his profound gratitude for the Savior and his consuming desire to follow Him. His teaching was an invitation for the Holy Ghost to testify of Jesus Christ. And the Spirit I felt in that class deepened my faith and increased my love and appreciation for the Savior. The influence of that teacher has stayed with me my entire life.
