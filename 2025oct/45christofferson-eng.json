A small bus carrying 20 young women of the Maputsoe Branch of the Church and seven of their leaders was headed to the capital city, Maseru, for a gathering of young women from their district. As they traveled the two-lane highway in the morning hours, a car coming in the opposite direction, attempting to pass another vehicle, came into the lane occupied by the bus. There was no space or time to avoid a head-on collision, and within seconds the vehicles hit, rolled off the road, and burst into flames.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168180523\" id=\"p_dj4Ra\">In all, 15 people died in the accident, including six young women, two Young Women leaders, and the branch president and his wife. Survivors, family members, and friends have expressed a range of emotions, including moments of anger, depression, and even guilt. Despite these feelings and unanswered questions, they have comforted one another and turned to God through sacred music, the scriptures, and prayer, where they have found solace. Seventeen-year-old survivor Setso\u2019ana Selebeli testified, \u201cJesus Christ loves us and is with us, even though our hearts hurt.\u201d<\/p>\n<img alt=\"Members in Lesotho\" id=\"img_fijW5\" src=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/2w9ec6ah6kmk5p9vb6sxqg8n6if6f7sxy5fuml2p/full/%21500%2C/0/default\" data-img-id=\"2w9ec6ah6kmk5p9vb6sxqg8n6if6f7sxy5fuml2p\" srcset=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/2w9ec6ah6kmk5p9vb6sxqg8n6if6f7sxy5fuml2p/full/%2160%2C/0/default 60w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/2w9ec6ah6kmk5p9vb6sxqg8n6if6f7sxy5fuml2p/full/%21100%2C/0/default 100w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/2w9ec6ah6kmk5p9vb6sxqg8n6if6f7sxy5fuml2p/full/%21200%2C/0/default 200w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/2w9ec6ah6kmk5p9vb6sxqg8n6if6f7sxy5fuml2p/full/%21250%2C/0/default 250w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/2w9ec6ah6kmk5p9vb6sxqg8n6if6f7sxy5fuml2p/full/%21320%2C/0/default 320w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/2w9ec6ah6kmk5p9vb6sxqg8n6if6f7sxy5fuml2p/full/%21500%2C/0/default 500w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/2w9ec6ah6kmk5p9vb6sxqg8n6if6f7sxy5fuml2p/full/%21640%2C/0/default 640w\" data-assetId=\"2w9ec6ah6kmk5p9vb6sxqg8n6if6f7sxy5fuml2p\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"281\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.7793594306049823\" data-public-title=\"Young Women who were in a bus accident in Lesotho\" data-public-description=\"Young Women who were in a bus accident in Lesotho\"/>\n<p data-aid=\"168180527\" id=\"p_flnwp\">A young woman and a leader who were hospitalized for burn treatments studied the Book of Mormon together.

It is only by looking to God that individuals, families, and even nations can flourish. President Russell M. Nelson taught, \u201cBecause the Savior, through His infinite Atonement, redeemed each of us from weakness, mistakes, and sin, and because He experienced every pain, worry, and burden you have ever had [see <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/7?lang=eng&amp;id=p11-p13#p11\">Alma 7:11\u201313<\/a>], then as you truly repent and seek His help, you can rise above this present precarious world.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"10\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168180564\" id=\"p_ds0RX\">No promise is repeated more often in Book of Mormon scripture than this: \u201cInasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments ye shall prosper in the land; but inasmuch as ye will not keep my commandments ye shall be cut off from my presence.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"11\"><\/sup><\/a> The lived experience of the Book of Mormon peoples over centuries demonstrates the truth of these words. \u201cProsper\u201d meant enjoying the guidance and blessings of heaven in their lives. \u201cProsper\u201d meant achieving levels of economic well-being that enabled them to marry, raise families, and minister to the needs of others. \u201cProspering\u201d included the capacity to rise above hardship and trial.

Another is the guidance found in the booklet <cite>For the Strength of Youth<\/cite>. The Young Men and Young Women theme for this year is \u201cLook unto Christ,\u201d drawn from the Lord\u2019s comforting direction to Joseph Smith and Oliver Cowdery: \u201cLook unto me in every thought; doubt not, fear not.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note16\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"16\"><\/sup><\/a> <cite>For the Strength of Youth<\/cite> speaks to several of God\u2019s most urgent commandments and standards and teaches how to look to the Lord in making good decisions. It is a guide not only for youth but for all of us.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168180569\" id=\"p_tJ695\">As one very important example, <cite>For the Strength of Youth<\/cite> has crucial guidance in the chapter titled \u201cYour Body Is Sacred.\u201d It instructs: \u201cTreat your body\u2014and others\u2019 bodies\u2014with respect. As you make decisions about your clothing, hairstyle, and appearance, ask yourself, \u2018Am I honoring my body as a sacred gift from God?\u2019\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168180573\" id=\"p_vi8qh\"><cite>For the Strength of Youth<\/cite> further states: \u201cKeep sex and sexual feelings sacred. They should not be the subject of jokes or entertainment. Outside of marriage between a man and a woman, it is wrong to touch the private, sacred parts of another person\u2019s body even if clothed. In your choices about what you do, look at, read, listen to, think about, post, or text, avoid anything that purposely arouses lustful emotions in others or yourself.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note17\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"17\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168180577\" id=\"p_dPQld\">This calls to mind President Nelson\u2019s recent admonition:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168180581\" id=\"p_cSjYy\">\u201cFew things will complicate your life more quickly than violating this divine law [of chastity]. For those who have made covenants with God, immorality is one of the quickest ways to lose your testimony.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168180586\" id=\"p_dPKFH\">\u201c\u2026 The power to create life is the <em>one privilege<\/em> of godhood that Heavenly Father allows His mortal children to exercise. Thus, God set clear guidelines for the use of this living, divine power. Physical intimacy is <em>only<\/em> for a man and a woman who are married to each other.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168180590\" id=\"p_zS0QN\">\u201cMuch of the world does not believe this, but public opinion is not the arbiter of truth. The Lord has declared that no unchaste person will attain the celestial kingdom. \u2026 If you have been unchaste, I plead with you to repent. Come unto Christ and receive His promise of <em>complete<\/em> forgiveness as you fully repent of your sins [see <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/ot/isa/1?lang=eng&amp;id=p16-p18#p16\">Isaiah 1:16\u201318<\/a>; <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/58?lang=eng&amp;id=p42-p43#p42\">Doctrine and Covenants 58:42\u201343<\/a>].\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note18\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"18\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168180593\" id=\"p_ex4lW\">Remember that in the Book of Mormon promise, the opposite of prosperity was not poverty\u2014it was being cut off from the presence of the Lord. His presence refers to the influence of His Spirit in one\u2019s life. All are imbued with the Light of Christ as they come into the world.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note19\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"19\"><\/sup><\/a> In addition, some act to be baptized and receive the gift and added light of the Holy Ghost. He brings inspiration and guidance, enhances and refines one\u2019s native gifts and abilities, and helps to avoid evil influences, poor decisions, and dead ends.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168180597\" id=\"p_iaTdf\">Like you, I know some who once enjoyed the gift of the Holy Ghost but who through failure to keep the commandments of God have lost that blessing. One in particular comes to mind whose membership in the Church had been withdrawn due to transgression. He said that his initial reaction was to feel offended. He felt judged by imperfect leaders. He knew his conduct had been wrong, but he rationalized it by pointing to the faults and failings of others. After a while, he began to feel comfortable in a lifestyle outside the Church without the obligation of callings and expectations of attending worship services and ministering to others.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168180601\" id=\"p_yyWrh\">This continued for some time, but he began to feel ever more keenly the absence of the Holy Spirit\u2014God\u2019s presence\u2014in his life. By experience, he knew what it was like to have, day by day, the comfort, guidance, and confidence born of the Spirit, and he missed it. Finally, he did what was needed to repent and qualify once more for baptism of water and of the Spirit.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168180603\" id=\"p_hT9II\">There seems to be no end to the different sources people look to for meaning, happiness, and help. Most are \u201clooking beyond the mark.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note20\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"20\"><\/sup><\/a> But we need not be \u201cchildren, tossed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine [or fashion].\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note21\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"21\"><\/sup><\/a> In looking to God, we can find peace in difficulty, and our faith can continue to grow even in times of doubt and spiritual challenge. We can receive strength in the face of opposition and isolation. We can reconcile the ideal with the present reality. Truly, there is no other way than what God Himself has ordained: \u201cLook unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none else.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note22\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"22\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168180609\" id=\"p_mEjhc\">Looking to God means that He is not just one of our priorities; it means, rather, that He is our one highest priority. I call to mind again that awful crash in Lesotho last June. From her hospital bed, one of the Young Women leaders who survived, who did not believe in God before joining the Church, said that her purpose is now to discover why her life was spared. \u201cConstantly serving God is how I will come to an answer, if I come to an answer,\u201d she stated. \u201cI used to think that I love God, but now I really, really, really, really, really love Him.
