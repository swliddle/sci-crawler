Introduction<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"168179215\" id=\"p_qnO0Q\">Thirty-three years ago, I received my call to serve as a missionary in the Utah Ogden Mission. Of course, because I was coming from Europe, some local Utah traditions like \u201cgreen Jell-O with carrots\u201d and \u201cfuneral potatoes\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"1\"><\/sup><\/a> were a bit peculiar to me!<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179219\" id=\"p_mD975\">However, I was deeply impressed by the devotion and discipleship of many of the Saints, the sheer number of people attending Church meetings, and the scale of fully functioning Church programs. When my mission came to an end, I wanted to make sure that the joy I felt and the spiritual strength and maturity I observed would also be available for my future family. I was determined to return quickly to live my life in the \u201cshadows of the everlasting hills.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"2\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179225\" id=\"p_zEnXM\">However, the Lord had different plans. On my first Sunday at home, my wise bishop called me to serve as the Young Men president in our ward. Serving this wonderful group of young men, I quickly learned that the joy that comes from being a disciple of Christ has very little to do with the size of Church meetings or the scale of programs.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179227\" id=\"p_aF6Cb\">So when I married my beautiful wife, Margret, we joyfully decided to stay in Europe and raise our family in our home country of Germany. Together we witnessed what President Russell M. Nelson taught many years ago: \u201cThe joy we feel has little to do with the circumstances of our lives and everything to do with the focus of our lives.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"3\"><\/sup><\/a> When the focus of our life is on Christ and His gospel message, we can experience the full blessings of discipleship wherever we live.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"sec_aXhX7\">\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"168179233\" id=\"p_v1hey\">2. The Simplicity That Is in Christ<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"168179236\" id=\"p_yG1EP\">However, in a world that is increasingly secular, complex, and confusing, with different and often conflicting messages and demands, how can we avoid our eyes becoming blinded and our hearts becoming hardened and remain focused on the \u201cplain and precious things\u201d of the gospel of Jesus Christ?<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"4\"><\/sup><\/a> During a time of confusion, the Apostle Paul gave great advice to the Saints of Corinth by reminding them to focus on \u201cthe simplicity that is in Christ.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"5\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179241\" id=\"p_mKkMK\">The doctrine of Christ and the law of the gospel are so simple that even little children can understand them. We can access the redeeming power of Jesus Christ and receive all the spiritual blessings our Heavenly Father has prepared for us by exercising faith in Jesus Christ, repenting, being baptized, being sanctified through the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"6\"><\/sup><\/a> President Nelson described this journey so beautifully as the \u201ccovenant path\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"7\"><\/sup><\/a> and the process of becoming a \u201cdevout disciple of Jesus Christ.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"8\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179243\" id=\"p_zK1Mc\">If this message is so simple, why does it often feel so challenging to live Christ\u2019s law and follow His example? It may be that we misinterpret simplicity as something that is easy to achieve without effort or diligence. Following Christ requires constant effort and continual change. We need to \u201c[put] off the natural man and \u2026 [become like a little] child.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"9\"><\/sup><\/a> This includes putting our \u201ctrust in the Lord\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"10\"><\/sup><\/a> and letting the complexity go, just as little children do.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"11\"><\/sup><\/a> Applying the doctrine of Christ in a simplified and focused way will help us to find joy in our daily lives, give guidance in our callings, answer some of life\u2019s most complex questions, and provide strength to face our greatest challenges.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179249\" id=\"p_mLhpq\">But how can we practically implement this simplicity in our lifelong journey as disciples of Christ? President Nelson reminded us to focus on \u201cpure truth, pure doctrine, and pure revelation\u201d as we seek to follow the Savior.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"12\"><\/sup><\/a> Regularly asking, \u201cWhat would the Lord Jesus Christ have me do?\u201d reveals profound direction. Following His example provides a safe path through uncertainty<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"13\"><\/sup><\/a> and a loving, guiding hand to hold from day to day. He is the Prince of Peace and the Good Shepherd.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note14\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"14\"><\/sup><\/a> He is our Comforter and Deliverer.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note15\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"15\"><\/sup><\/a> He is our Rock and Refuge.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note16\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"16\"><\/sup><\/a> He is a Friend\u2014your friend and my friend!<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note17\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"17\"><\/sup><\/a> He invites us all to love God, keep His commandments, and love our neighbor.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note18\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"18\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179252\" id=\"p_kOIrt\">As we choose to follow His example and move forward with faith in Christ, embrace the power of His Atonement, and remember our covenants, love fills our hearts, hope and healing raise our spirits, and bitterness and sorrow are replaced by gratitude and the patience to wait for promised blessings. At times, we may need to distance ourselves from an unhealthy situation or seek professional help. But in every case, applying simple gospel principles will help us navigate through life\u2019s challenges in the Lord\u2019s way.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179258\" id=\"p_bNjU2\">We sometimes underestimate the strength we receive from simple acts like prayer, fasting, scripture study, daily repentance, partaking of the sacrament weekly, and regular worship in the house of the Lord. But when we recognize that we don\u2019t need to \u201cdo some great thing\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note19\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"19\"><\/sup><\/a> and we center ourselves on applying pure and simple doctrine, we start to see how the gospel \u201cworks wonderfully\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note20\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"20\"><\/sup><\/a> for us, even in the most challenging circumstances. We find strength and \u201cconfidence before God,\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note21\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"21\"><\/sup><\/a> even when we experience heartache. Elder M. Russell Ballard has reminded us many times, \u201cIt is in that simplicity that [we] will find \u2026 peace, joy, and happiness.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note22\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"22\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179262\" id=\"p_rTdxR\">Applying the simplicity that is in Christ makes us prioritize people over processes and eternal relationships over short-term behaviors.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note23\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"23\"><\/sup><\/a> We focus on \u201cthe things that matter most\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note24\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"24\"><\/sup><\/a> in God\u2019s work of salvation and exaltation instead of getting caught up in managing our ministering. We make ourselves free to prioritize the things we <i>can<\/i> do rather than being weighed down by the things we <i>cannot<\/i> do. The Lord reminded us: \u201cWherefore, be not weary in well-doing, for ye are laying the foundation of a great work.

In 1930 she married my grandfather, who was not a member of the Church. At this point it became impossible for Oma to attend Church meetings because my grandfather\u2019s farm was far away from the nearest congregation. But she focused on what she could do. Oma continued to pray, read the scriptures, and sing the songs of Zion.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179281\" id=\"p_b5PRk\">Some people might have thought she was no longer active in her faith, but that was far from the truth. When my aunt and my father were born, with no priesthood in the home and no Church meetings or access to ordinances nearby, she again did what she could do and focused on teaching her children \u201cto pray, and to walk uprightly before the Lord.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note27\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"27\"><\/sup><\/a> She read to them from the scriptures, sang with them the songs of Zion, and of course prayed with them\u2014every day. A 100 percent home-centered Church experience.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179283\" id=\"p_fzO9I\">In 1945 my grandfather was serving in the war far away from home. When enemies approached their farm, Oma took her two little children and left their beloved farm behind to seek refuge in a safer place. After a difficult and life-threatening journey, they finally found refuge in May of 1945 in northern Germany. They had nothing left except the clothes on their bodies. But Oma continued with what she was able to do: she prayed with her children\u2014every day. She sang with them the songs of Zion she had memorized by heart\u2014every day.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179290\" id=\"p_m0XFH\">Life was extremely hard and for many years focused on simply making sure there was food on the table. But in 1955 my dad, then 17 years old, was going to trade school in the city of Rendsburg. He walked by a building and saw a small sign on the outside that read \u201cKirche Jesu Christi der Heiligen der Letzten Tage\u201d\u2014\u201cThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\u201d He thought, \u201cThat is interesting; this is Mother\u2019s church.\u201d So when he came home, he told Oma that he had found her church.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179293\" id=\"p_xcD9J\">You can imagine how she must have felt after almost 25 years of no contact with the Church. She was determined to attend the next Sunday and convinced my father to accompany her. Rendsburg was more than 20 miles (32 km) away from the little village where they lived. But this would not keep Oma from attending church. The next Sunday, she got on her bicycle together with my father and rode to church.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179295\" id=\"p_eAZ7g\">When the sacrament meeting started, my dad sat down in the last row, hoping it would be over soon. This was Oma\u2019s church and not his. What he saw was not very encouraging: only a few older women in attendance and two young missionaries who effectively ran everything in the meeting. But then they started to sing, and they sang the songs of Zion that my dad had heard since he was a little boy: \u201cCome, Come, Ye Saints,\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note28\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"28\"><\/sup><\/a> \u201cO My Father,\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note29\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"29\"><\/sup><\/a> \u201cPraise to the Man.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note30\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"30\"><\/sup><\/a> Hearing this little flock sing the songs of Zion he\u2019d known since childhood pierced his heart, and he knew immediately and without a doubt that the Church was true.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179299\" id=\"p_wUmXw\">The first sacrament meeting my grandmother attended after 25 years was the meeting where my father received a personal confirmation of the truthfulness of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. He was baptized three weeks later, on September 25, 1955, together with my grandfather and my aunt.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179304\" id=\"p_q4nSZ\">It has been more than 70 years since that tiny sacrament meeting in Rendsburg. I often think about Oma, how she must have felt in those lonely nights, doing the small and simple things she was able to do, like praying, reading, and singing. As I stand here today in general conference and talk about my Oma, her determination to keep her covenants and trust in the Lord notwithstanding her struggles fills my heart with humility and gratitude\u2014not only for her but for so many of our wonderful Saints throughout the world who focus on the simplicity in Christ in their challenging circumstances, perhaps seeing little change now but trusting that great things will come to pass some day in the future.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"sec_vM2Ih\">\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"168179306\" id=\"p_uVWnP\">4.
