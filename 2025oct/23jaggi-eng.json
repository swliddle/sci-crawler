I received an invitation to tour Hill Air Force Base near Layton, Utah. I had never been on a military base, nor had I met a military chaplain or the men and women who work to provide safety and protection for their country.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179539\" id=\"p_yNy0O\">Chaplain Harp, like thousands of other volunteer and professional chaplains who serve in our prisons, hospitals, and military installations around the world, inspired and uplifted me. Our last stop on the base was the sanctuary. I asked the chaplain if he administered services for all people who desired to ponder, pray, meditate, and worship. He went to the front wall of the chapel, and he pulled a cross from behind the curtains. He said he used the cross for Protestant and Catholic services. I asked what he used for our Jewish brothers and sisters, and he went to the other side of the front wall, and he pulled out a Star of David.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179545\" id=\"p_ygqI5\">I then asked, \u201cWhat do you do for Latter-day Saint services?\u201d He pushed those symbols away and pointed to the large wooden altar in the middle of the sanctuary. He said that members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints prepare and bless the bread and water on the altar.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"3\"><\/sup><\/a> I asked if the large, seemingly fixed altar was removed before the services of our Jewish, Muslim, Catholic, or Protestant brothers and sisters. He said that the altar stays in place, for several of those faiths also utilize the altar in some way.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179555\" id=\"p_fyNfc\">Abraham built an altar, bound Isaac, and was ready to sacrifice his only son, but his hand was stayed, and he declared, like the Lord has declared, \u201cHere am I\u201d!<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"4\"><\/sup><\/a> How many times has the Great I Am or one of His prophets volunteered, \u201cHere am I\u201d?<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"5\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179564\" id=\"p_xiv2P\">During His Sermon on the Mount, the Savior invited us to reconcile with our brothers and sisters before we approach the altar.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"6\"><\/sup><\/a> Paul taught that we are \u201csanctified\u201d at the altar through the Atonement of Jesus Christ.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"7\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179571\" id=\"p_z3545\">The prophet Lehi \u201cleft his house \u2026 and his precious things. \u2026 [Then] he built an altar \u2026\u2060 and made an offering \u2026 , and gave thanks unto the Lord.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"8\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179578\" id=\"p_fT3Vc\">The Bible and the Book of Mormon teach us to worship the Son of God at altars. Why?<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179586\" id=\"p_rK8Q1\">Our first parents, Adam and Eve, built and worshipped at altars.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"9\"><\/sup><\/a> After they were cast out of the Garden of Eden and had worshipped for \u201cmany days,\u201d an angel visited and asked a poignant question that could be asked of each of us: \u201cWhy dost thou offer sacrifices unto the Lord?\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179593\" id=\"p_soZ7V\">Adam answered, \u201cI know not.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179601\" id=\"p_qpdKb\">The angel\u2019s response to Adam\u2019s humble admission is stunning: \u201cThis \u2026 is a similitude of the sacrifice of the Only Begotten of the Father. \u2026 Wherefore, thou shalt do all that thou doest in the name of the Son, and thou shalt repent and call upon God in the name of the Son forevermore.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"10\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179609\" id=\"p_xeHHd\">The sacrament table and temple altars symbolize the sacrifice of Jesus Christ and His infinite Atonement.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179618\" id=\"p_di7kK\">As we make and honor our covenants, receiving the ordinances of the sacrament at church and the endowment and sealing at the temple, we bind ourselves to the Savior, gaining greater access to His mercy, protection,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"11\"><\/sup><\/a> sanctification, healing, and rest.<\/p>\n<section id=\"sec_zKIxQ\">\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"168179628\" id=\"p_bLkXA\">Mercy and Protection Through Covenants<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"168179638\" id=\"p_yBxmJ\">As a 15-year-old young man, I asked my dad if I could skip sacrament meeting\u2014just one Sunday in January for a special American football game. He said I was old enough to make that choice for myself and asked me to consider one piece of counsel. He said, \u201cIf you choose to miss the sacrament once, it\u2019s much easier to choose to miss it again.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179649\" id=\"p_y3Kpe\">If the Savior is the great connector, then the adversary is the separator.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"12\"><\/sup><\/a> He, Satan, tempts us to separate ourselves from our consecrated<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"13\"><\/sup><\/a> places of worship and from the protection of Jesus Christ.
