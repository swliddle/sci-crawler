Nelson marveled at the efforts of the pioneers who, with limited resources and unwavering faith, built that sacred edifice, a physical and spiritual masterpiece that has stood the test of time. However, he also observed the effects of erosion, which over time had caused gaps in the temple\u2019s original foundation stones and instability in the masonry, clear signs of the need for structural reinforcement.<\/p>\n<img alt=\"President Nelson outside the Salt Lake Temple\" id=\"img_si9M8\" src=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/6l7nhbw1qte2vy7wm97dhgpp8bykvokyrtdnj086/full/%21500%2C/0/default\" data-img-id=\"6l7nhbw1qte2vy7wm97dhgpp8bykvokyrtdnj086\" srcset=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/6l7nhbw1qte2vy7wm97dhgpp8bykvokyrtdnj086/full/%2160%2C/0/default 60w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/6l7nhbw1qte2vy7wm97dhgpp8bykvokyrtdnj086/full/%21100%2C/0/default 100w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/6l7nhbw1qte2vy7wm97dhgpp8bykvokyrtdnj086/full/%21200%2C/0/default 200w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/6l7nhbw1qte2vy7wm97dhgpp8bykvokyrtdnj086/full/%21250%2C/0/default 250w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/6l7nhbw1qte2vy7wm97dhgpp8bykvokyrtdnj086/full/%21320%2C/0/default 320w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/6l7nhbw1qte2vy7wm97dhgpp8bykvokyrtdnj086/full/%21500%2C/0/default 500w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/6l7nhbw1qte2vy7wm97dhgpp8bykvokyrtdnj086/full/%21640%2C/0/default 640w\" data-assetId=\"6l7nhbw1qte2vy7wm97dhgpp8bykvokyrtdnj086\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"281\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.7793594306049823\" data-public-title=\"President Nelson looks at the construction of the Salt Lake Temple - 2021\" data-public-description=\"President Nelson looks at the construction of the Salt Lake Temple - 2021\"/>\n<p data-aid=\"168179712\" id=\"p_cch7z\">Our beloved prophet then taught us that just as it was necessary to implement major measures to strengthen the foundation of the temple in order for it to withstand the forces of nature, we also need to take extraordinary measures\u2014perhaps measures we have never before taken\u2014to strengthen our own spiritual foundation in Jesus Christ. In his memorable message, he left us with two profound questions for personal reflection: \u201cHow firm is <em>your<\/em> foundation? And what reinforcements to your testimony and understanding of the gospel are needed?\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"1\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179725\" id=\"p_lPsqT\">The gospel of Jesus Christ provides us with divinely inspired and effective means to prevent the spiritual erosion in our souls, powerfully reinforcing our foundation and helping us avoid gaps in our faith and instability in both our testimony and our understanding of the sacred truths of the gospel. One particularly relevant principle for achieving this purpose is found in <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/12?lang=eng\">section 12 of the Doctrine and Covenants<\/a>, a revelation given through the Prophet Joseph Smith to Joseph Knight, a righteous man who earnestly sought to understand the Lord\u2019s will, not for mere outward change but to stand unwavering in his discipleship\u2014\u201cfirm as the pillars of heaven.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"2\"><\/sup><\/a> The Lord declared:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179739\" id=\"p_dnNnh\">\u201cBehold, I speak unto you, and also to all those who have desires to bring forth and establish this work;<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179753\" id=\"p_gTuSC\">\u201cAnd no one can assist in this work except he shall be humble and full of love, having faith, hope, and charity, being temperate in all things, whatsoever shall be entrusted to his care.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"3\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179767\" id=\"p_tMEfe\">The Savior\u2019s guidance, recorded in this sacred revelation, reminds us that temperance is an essential reinforcement for a firm foundation in Jesus Christ. It is one of the indispensable virtues, not only for those who have been called to serve but also for all who have made sacred covenants with the Lord and accept to follow Him faithfully. Temperance harmonizes and strengthens other Christlike attributes mentioned in this revelation: humility, faith, hope, charity, and the pure love that flows from Him. Furthermore, cultivating temperance is a meaningful way to protect our souls against the subtle yet constant spiritual erosion caused by worldly influences that can weaken our foundation in Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179781\" id=\"p_ooxt9\">Among the qualities that adorn true disciples of Christ, temperance stands out as a reflection of the Savior Himself, a precious fruit of the Spirit, available to all who open themselves to divine influence. It is the virtue that brings harmony to the heart, shaping desires and emotions with wisdom and calmness. In the scriptures, temperance is presented as an essential part of the progress in our spiritual journey, leading us toward patience, godliness, and compassion while refining our feelings, our words, and our actions.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179795\" id=\"p_nfaoR\">Disciples of Christ who strive to cultivate this Christlike attribute become increasingly humble and full of love. A serene strength arises in them, and they become better capable of restraining anger, nurturing patience, and treating others with tolerance, respect, and dignity, even when the winds of adversity blow fiercely. They strive not to act impulsively but choose to act with spiritual wisdom, guided by meekness and the gentle influence of the Holy Spirit. In this way, they become less vulnerable to spiritual erosion because, as the Apostle Paul taught, they know that they can do all things through Christ, who strengthens them<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"4\"><\/sup><\/a> even in the face of trials that could shake their testimony of Him.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179809\" id=\"p_yzlFK\">In his Epistle to Titus, Paul conveyed sacred counsel regarding the qualifications of those who desire to represent the Savior and do His will with faith and dedication. He said they should be hospitable, sober, just, and holy\u2014qualities that clearly reflect the influence of temperance.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"5\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179823\" id=\"p_ow4pd\">However, Paul warned that they should be \u201cnot selfwilled, not soon angry, \u2026 [and] no striker.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"6\"><\/sup><\/a> Such characteristics are contrary to the mind of the Savior and hinder true spiritual growth. In the scriptural context, \u201cnot selfwilled\u201d is one who refuses to act with arrogance and pride;<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"7\"><\/sup><\/a> \u201cnot soon angry\u201d is one who avoids the natural urge to become impatient and irritated;<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"8\"><\/sup><\/a> and \u201cno striker\u201d refers to one who rejects contentious, aggressive, and harsh behavior verbally, physically, and emotionally.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"9\"><\/sup><\/a> As we strive to change our behavior with faith and humility, we can be firmly anchored to the solid rock of His grace<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"10\"><\/sup><\/a> and become pure and polished instruments in His holy hands.<\/p>\n<img alt=\"Hannah and Samuel\" id=\"img_ma52v\" src=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/e79c9ea6817a62c2892e12f568ee3c2d4233549a/full/%21500%2C/0/default\" data-img-id=\"e79c9ea6817a62c2892e12f568ee3c2d4233549a\" srcset=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/e79c9ea6817a62c2892e12f568ee3c2d4233549a/full/%2160%2C/0/default 60w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/e79c9ea6817a62c2892e12f568ee3c2d4233549a/full/%21100%2C/0/default 100w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/e79c9ea6817a62c2892e12f568ee3c2d4233549a/full/%21200%2C/0/default 200w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/e79c9ea6817a62c2892e12f568ee3c2d4233549a/full/%21250%2C/0/default 250w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/e79c9ea6817a62c2892e12f568ee3c2d4233549a/full/%21320%2C/0/default 320w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/e79c9ea6817a62c2892e12f568ee3c2d4233549a/full/%21500%2C/0/default 500w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/e79c9ea6817a62c2892e12f568ee3c2d4233549a/full/%21640%2C/0/default 640w\" data-assetId=\"e79c9ea6817a62c2892e12f568ee3c2d4233549a\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"322\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.5527950310559007\" data-public-title=\"Hannah and Samuel\" data-public-description=\"Illustration of the Biblical prophet Samuel as a young boy with his mother, Hannah.\"/>\n<p data-aid=\"168179834\" id=\"p_tQFyl\">In reflecting on the need to cultivate the virtue of temperance, I am reminded of the words of Hannah, the mother of the prophet Samuel\u2014a woman of remarkable faith who, even after great trials, offered a song of gratitude to the Lord. She said, \u201cTalk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogancy come out of your mouth: for the Lord is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"11\"><\/sup><\/a> Her song is more than a prayer\u2014it is a self-addressed invitation to act with humility, self-control, and moderation. Hannah reminds us that true spiritual strength is not expressed in impulsive reactions or haughty words but in temperate, thoughtful attitudes aligned with the Lord\u2019s wisdom.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179847\" id=\"p_cDpmD\">Oftentimes, the world exalts behaviors born of aggressiveness, arrogance, impatience, and excessiveness, often justifying such attitudes by the pressures of daily life and the inclination toward validation and popularity. When we turn our gaze away from the virtue of temperance and ignore the gentle and moderating influence of the Holy Spirit in our way of acting and speaking, we easily fall into the enemy\u2019s trap, which inevitably leads us to utter words and adopt attitudes we will deeply regret, whether in our social, family, or even ecclesiastical relationships. The gospel of Jesus Christ invites us to exercise this virtue especially in times of challenge, for it is precisely on these occasions that the true character of an individual is revealed. As Martin Luther King Jr. once said, \u201cThe ultimate measure of a man is not where he stands in moments of comfort and convenience, but where he stands at times of challenge and controversy.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"12\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179861\" id=\"p_xAo5q\">As covenant people, we are called to live with our hearts firmly rooted in the sacred promises we have made to the Lord, carefully following the pattern He established through His perfect example.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"13\"><\/sup><\/a> In return, He has promised, \u201cVerily, verily, I say unto you, that this is my doctrine, and whoso buildeth upon this buildeth upon my rock, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against them.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note14\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"14\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<figure class=\"image no-print\" id=\"fig_bQR7K\">\n<img alt=\"The Savior\" id=\"img_cy3n1\" src=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/dc1dee10238b11ef8dedeeeeac1edb6ac8d59ca0/full/%21500%2C/0/default\" data-img-id=\"dc1dee10238b11ef8dedeeeeac1edb6ac8d59ca0\" srcset=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/dc1dee10238b11ef8dedeeeeac1edb6ac8d59ca0/full/%2160%2C/0/default 60w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/dc1dee10238b11ef8dedeeeeac1edb6ac8d59ca0/full/%21100%2C/0/default 100w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/dc1dee10238b11ef8dedeeeeac1edb6ac8d59ca0/full/%21200%2C/0/default 200w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/dc1dee10238b11ef8dedeeeeac1edb6ac8d59ca0/full/%21250%2C/0/default 250w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/dc1dee10238b11ef8dedeeeeac1edb6ac8d59ca0/full/%21320%2C/0/default 320w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/dc1dee10238b11ef8dedeeeeac1edb6ac8d59ca0/full/%21500%2C/0/default 500w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/dc1dee10238b11ef8dedeeeeac1edb6ac8d59ca0/full/%21640%2C/0/default 640w\" data-assetId=\"dc1dee10238b11ef8dedeeeeac1edb6ac8d59ca0\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"428\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.1682242990654206\" data-public-title=\"Let Your Heart Not Be Troubled\" data-public-description=\"A portrait of Jesus Christ with a shawl on His head.\"/>\n<figcaption>\n<p data-aid=\"168179875\" id=\"p_tmNFF\"><cite>Let Not Your Heart Be Troubled<\/cite>, by Howard Lyon, courtesy of Havenlight<\/p>\n<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p data-aid=\"168179888\" id=\"p_cmXTc\">The Savior\u2019s ministry on earth was marked by the virtue of temperance in all aspects of His character. Through His perfect example, He taught us to \u201cbe patient in afflictions, revile not against those that revile.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note15\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"15\"><\/sup><\/a> As He taught that we should not give in to anger because of disputes and contentions, He declared, \u201cYe must repent, and become as a little child.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note16\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"16\"><\/sup><\/a> He also taught that all who desire to come unto Him with full purpose of heart must reconcile with those with whom they are angry or with those who have something against them.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note17\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"17\"><\/sup><\/a> With a temperate attitude and a compassionate heart, He assured us that when we are treated with harshness, unkindness, disrespect, or disregard, His kindness will not depart from us, and the covenant of His peace shall not be removed from our lives.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note18\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"18\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179901\" id=\"p_pjcrL\">A few years ago, my wife and I had the sacred privilege of meeting with some faithful members of the Church in Mexico City. Many of them, either personally or through their loved ones, had endured indescribable trials, including kidnappings, homicides, and other heartbreaking tragedies.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179915\" id=\"p_c2QkY\">As we looked into the faces of those Saints, we did not see anger, resentment, or a desire for revenge. Instead, we saw a quiet humility. Their countenances, though marked by sorrow, radiated a sincere longing for healing and comfort. Even though their hearts were broken by suffering, these Saints pressed forward with faith in Jesus Christ, choosing not to let their afflictions become gaps in their faith or cause instability in their testimony of the gospel.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179928\" id=\"p_xYYyg\">At the conclusion of that sacred gathering, we greeted each one of them. Every handshake, every embrace became a quiet testimony that with the help of the Lord, we can choose to respond with temperance to the frustrations and challenges of life. Their quiet and unassuming example served as a tender invitation to walk the Savior\u2019s path with temperance in all things. We felt as if we were in the presence of angels.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179941\" id=\"p_sVzJL\">Jesus Christ, the greatest of all, suffered for us until He bled from every pore, yet He never allowed anger to inflame His heart, nor did aggressive, offensive, or profane words escape His lips, even amid such affliction. With perfect temperance and unmatched meekness, He did not think of Himself but of each of God\u2019s children\u2014past, present, and future. The Apostle Peter testified of Christ\u2019s sublime attitude when he declared, \u201cWho, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered, he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth righteously.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note19\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"19\"><\/sup><\/a> Even in the midst of His greatest agony, the Savior demonstrated perfect and divine temperance. He declared, \u201cNevertheless, glory be to the Father, and I partook and finished my preparations unto the children of men.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note20\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"20\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179954\" id=\"p_o5V99\">My beloved brothers and sisters, I extend an earnest invitation to all of us to adorn our minds and hearts with the Christlike virtue of temperance as a sacred response to the prophetic call of our dear President Russell M. Nelson. As we strive with faith and diligence to weave temperance into our actions and words, I testify that we will strengthen and anchor our lives more securely upon the sure foundation of our Redeemer.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179967\" id=\"p_wwj2T\">I solemnly bear my testimony that the constant pursuit of temperance purifies our soul and sanctifies our heart before the Savior, gently drawing us nearer to Him and preparing us, with hope and peace, for that glorious day when we shall meet Him at His Second Coming. I share these sacred words in the name of our Savior, Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<footer class=\"notes\">\n<p class=\"title\" data-aid=\"168179980\" id=\"p_bKQA9\">Notes<\/p>\n<ol class=\"decimal\" data-type=\"marker\" start=\"1\">\n<li data-marker=\"1.\" id=\"note1\" data-full-marker=\"1.\">\n<p data-aid=\"168179993\" id=\"p_aFkE0\">Russell M.
