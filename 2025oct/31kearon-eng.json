What an enormous understatement that is! Jesus surely did go about doing good! He is the very essence\u2014and source\u2014of goodness!<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"2\"><\/sup><\/a> He devoted His entire mortal life to doing good. He is \u201cmerciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant,\u201d infinite in goodness and everlasting in mercy.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"3\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179218\" id=\"p_yWZ4r\">Any attempt at describing or summarising His goodness and mercy would be an understatement! Truly, as the Apostle John tried to express, if we were to attempt to record every manifestation of the Saviour\u2019s goodness, \u201ceven the world itself could not contain the books that should be written.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"4\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"sec_lNgYE\">\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"168179226\" id=\"p_sGUus\">Jesus Christ Offers Each of Us a New Beginning<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"168179229\" id=\"p_bYSLT\">The specific examples we do have immortalised in scripture of Jesus going about \u201cdoing good\u201d stir deep awe and wonder, especially when we really consider what it might have been like to be there, to witness His miracles, to receive His teachings, and to experience His healing. He conversed with the social outcasts, He touched the diseased and unclean, He brought comfort to the weary, He taught liberating truth, and He called sinners to repentance. To each leper, blind man, and adulterous woman; to the lame, the deaf, and the dumb; to every grieving mother, desperate father, and mourning widow; to the condemned, the shamed, and the suffering; to the dead in body and the dead in spirit, what He did was offer a new beginning. Yes, another staggering understatement!<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179232\" id=\"p_nPETm\">Everything He said and did provided a new beginning for each of those He healed, blessed, taught, and relieved of sin. He didn\u2019t withdraw from them, and He certainly won\u2019t withdraw from you. Imagine in this moment hearing any of these life-giving words from Him:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179235\" id=\"p_k5TM2\">\u201cSon, thy sins be forgiven thee.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"5\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179242\" id=\"p_vIRbx\">\u201cDamsel, I say unto thee, arise.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"6\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179245\" id=\"p_hfypr\">\u201cBe thou clean.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"7\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179248\" id=\"p_fh6bC\">\u201cNeither do I condemn thee: go, and sin no more.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"8\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179251\" id=\"p_hYm2U\">\u201cDaughter, be of good comfort: thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"9\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179257\" id=\"p_zxJHK\">The Saviour\u2019s words to these individuals were brief, but with them He painted vast new horizons of forgiveness, healing, restoration, peace, and eternal life. And the glorious news is He offers the same new beginning to you and to me. All of us can have a new beginning through, and because of, Jesus Christ. Even you.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"10\"><\/sup><\/a> New beginnings are at the heart of the Father\u2019s plan for His children. This is the church of new beginnings! This is the church of fresh starts!<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"sec_sHARS\">\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"168179261\" id=\"p_jFajy\">This Is the Church of New Beginnings<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"168179264\" id=\"p_zLkV5\">With baptism by water and the Spirit, we are \u201cborn again\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"11\"><\/sup><\/a> and can \u201cwalk in newness of life.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"12\"><\/sup><\/a> How much hope does that new beginning bring to one who has trudged under the burden of sin or suffered from the effects of a troubled life and dysfunctional relationships? Jesus needed no forgiveness of sin Himself or a fresh start in life, yet He was baptised, showing us in high relief the way to the new beginning He has carved for each of us.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179267\" id=\"p_kO3Yl\">And our new beginning doesn\u2019t just happen once. We tend to think that our baptism is our one shot at a new beginning. It isn\u2019t. We don\u2019t have just one chance. These new beginnings can happen every day! And certainly every week as we eat a small piece of bread and drink a tiny cup of water in remembrance of the gift of our perfect Saviour, who died for the express purpose of giving us as many new beginnings as we need! Jesus gives us as many new beginnings as we need.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"13\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179271\" id=\"p_m3bWx\">With commitment and rejoicing in a new life in Christ, we can become \u201ca new creature,\u201d where old things pass away and all things become new.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note14\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"14\"><\/sup><\/a> What reprieve does that kind of new dawn bring to a soul who keeps trying, through continuing to choose faith in our Redeemer\u2019s power to heal and restore, despite the crushing setbacks of living in a fallen world?

Our dear President Russell M. Nelson\u2019s teachings have cleared up misconceptions about the divine gift of repentance, and I think we are finally beginning to grasp it.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note17\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"17\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179288\" id=\"p_nz9Uu\">It is exciting to hear our youth describe what repentance means to them. I recently heard a young woman say, with a smile on her face, \u201cWhen I think of repentance, daily repentance, I feel incredible joy and hope. I feel the love and happiness of my Heavenly Father and my Saviour. I am not afraid to come to Heavenly Father in prayer and ask for His help with whatever I\u2019m struggling with. I know They\u2019re not trying to catch me doing something wrong. Their arms are open wide. This is repentance to me,\u201d she said. This young woman understands that because of Jesus Christ, she can have new beginnings!<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"sec_ryVwU\">\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"168179291\" id=\"p_p7mkz\">A New Beginning for Everyone, Every Time<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"168179298\" id=\"p_ao0PL\">Do you need a new beginning? Can you make a fresh start, even you? Think about the people the Saviour ministered to\u2014the people He taught, healed, raised, forgave, and restored. Was He selecting them from a particular economic class or background? Was He distinguishing between the righteous and the sinful? Was He singling people out because they were more deserving or more loved? No.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179303\" id=\"p_gE3aJ\">Some came to Him with great faith, believing in His power to heal\u2014like the woman with the issue of blood,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note18\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"18\"><\/sup><\/a> the Roman centurion whose servant was dying,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note19\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"19\"><\/sup><\/a> the leper,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note20\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"20\"><\/sup><\/a> Jairus,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note21\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"21\"><\/sup><\/a> and blind Bartimaeus.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note22\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"22\"><\/sup><\/a> They each put their faith on the line, hoping that the goodness and power of the rabbi from Nazareth would change their lives and their prospects. And He did. He let His healing flow.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179307\" id=\"p_wRkLA\">But Jesus also blessed those who had wavering faith, like the father of the sick child who cried out, perhaps as you have, \u201cLord, I believe; help thou mine unbelief.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note23\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"23\"><\/sup><\/a> And He even poured out compassion upon those who hadn\u2019t sought Him at all, like the woman taken in adultery,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note24\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"24\"><\/sup><\/a> the widow of Nain,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note25\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"25\"><\/sup><\/a> the disabled man at the pool of Bethesda,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note26\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"26\"><\/sup><\/a> and the man born blind.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note27\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"27\"><\/sup><\/a> Have you felt Him going about doing good in your life even when you haven\u2019t been seeking Him or following Him?<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179311\" id=\"p_inQLM\">To each of these scriptural figures, and to all who would listen and respond, He gave a new beginning, whether it was a new life forgiven of sin or a new life healed of disease or a new life raised from death.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179315\" id=\"p_rT5rv\">What does this mean for you and for me? His goodness and mercy and loving-kindness know no bounds. New beginnings are at the heart of the Father\u2019s plan! Fresh starts are the mission of the Son! New dawns, new chapters, and new chances are the simple core of the gospel\u2019s good news!<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179318\" id=\"p_fTwwM\">So, have you been away too long from your covenants to receive a new beginning? No. Have you done this or that too many times to be given another chance? No. Have you gone too far from Christ for Him to help you write a new story from here on out? No. The adversary is the only one who benefits from the idea that you\u2019re sunk. You are not.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179322\" id=\"p_lWZHZ\">And new beginnings are for more than just our sins and mistakes. Through the goodness and grace of the Saviour, we can have fresh starts that propel change in old mindsets, bad habits, grumpy dispositions, negative attitudes, feelings of powerlessness, and tendencies to blame others and avoid personal responsibility. You can actually change things about yourself that have been wearing you down for years. You can start again through the might of the Master of new beginnings. He never tires of giving new beginnings to us.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179326\" id=\"p_yJRwF\">To those who are struggling with the same sin or the same setback over and over again, you keep going. He hasn\u2019t put a roadblock in front of you. He hasn\u2019t set a limit on your second chances. You press on. You keep striving. You seek help from those around you. And you trust in the new beginning that is there for you every time you turn back to your Father in sincerity of heart. Leave deliberate sinning, casual repeats, and prideful rebellion behind you, where they belong. You don\u2019t have to be who you\u2019ve been before. Embrace your fresh start, your second or third or fourth\u2014or hundredth\u2014chance, offered to you through the atoning blood of Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179330\" id=\"p_h8Ykt\">I am grateful beyond description for the new beginnings I have been given and for those I will yet be offered.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"sec_w7U1g\">\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"168179334\" id=\"p_fDK9l\">Conclusion<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"168179340\" id=\"p_brrv8\">Our Saviour uttered one final understatement, without which there would be no cause for hope or rejoicing this day. After the agonies of Gethsemane and at the conclusion of the torturous cross, He simply said, \u201cIt is finished.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note28\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"28\"><\/sup><\/a> Messianic prophecy had been fulfilled, and the full payment of the debt for humanity\u2019s sins and suffering had been paid.
