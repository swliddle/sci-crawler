Eyre<\/p>\n<p class=\"author-role\" data-aid=\"168178383\" id=\"p_aiziO\">Of the Seventy<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"kicker\" data-aid=\"168178385\" id=\"p_rGeOb\">Regardless of where we are on our path of discipleship, our lives will fundamentally change if we better understand who we really are.<\/p>\n<\/header>\n<div class=\"body-block\">\n<p data-aid=\"168178387\" id=\"p_ltGnd\">Several years ago our daughter had a profound experience on her mission. With her approval, I share an excerpt of what she wrote to us that week:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168178390\" id=\"p_n1wCC\">\u201cYesterday a returning member asked us to come over as soon as possible. When we arrived, we found her on the floor, sobbing uncontrollably. Through the tears, we found out that she had lost her job, was going to be evicted from her apartment, and once again become homeless.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168178392\" id=\"p_mnHih\">Our daughter continued: \u201cI started frantically searching my scriptures, trying to find something\u2014anything\u2014to help her. As I was looking for the perfect verse, I thought, \u2018What am I doing? This is not what Christ would do. This is not a problem that I can solve, but this is a literal daughter of God who needs my help.\u2019 So I closed my scriptures, knelt beside her, and held her while we cried together, until she was ready to stand up and face this trial.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168178394\" id=\"p_psJ73\">After this woman was comforted, our daughter then used the scriptures to try and help her understand the reality of her divine worth and to teach her one of the most fundamental truths of our existence\u2014that we are beloved sons and daughters of God, a God that feels perfect compassion for us when we suffer and is ready to assist us as we stand back up.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168178397\" id=\"p_mls6U\">It is insightful that the first point of doctrine that our missionaries teach is that God is our loving Heavenly Father. Every subsequent truth builds on the foundational understanding of who we really are.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"1\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168178399\" id=\"p_pkg0a\">Susan H. Porter, Primary General President, taught: \u201cWhen you know and understand how completely you are loved as a child of God, it changes everything. It changes the way you feel about yourself when you make mistakes. It changes how you feel when difficult things happen. It changes your view of God\u2019s commandments. It changes your view of others and of your capacity to make a difference.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"2\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168178402\" id=\"p_yn7zr\">This change is illustrated as we read about the experience Moses had when talking with God face-to-face. During that conversation, God repeatedly taught Moses of his divine heritage, saying, \u201cMoses, \u2026 thou art my son.\u201d God explained that Moses was in the similitude of His Only Begotten. Moses came to understand clearly who he was, that he had a work to do, and that he had a loving Heavenly Father.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"3\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168178405\" id=\"p_yYREC\">After this experience, the adversary came tempting him and immediately addressed him by saying, \u201cMoses, son of man.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"4\"><\/sup><\/a> This is a common and dangerous tool in the arsenal of the adversary. While our Heavenly Father consistently and lovingly reminds us that we are His children, the adversary will always try to label us by our weaknesses. But Moses had already learned that he was more than a \u201cson of man.\u201d He declared to Satan: \u201cWho art thou? For behold, I am a son of God.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"5\"><\/sup><\/a> Similarly, when we are confronted with the challenges of mortality or when we feel like anyone is trying to label us by our weaknesses, we need to stand strong in the knowledge of who we truly are. We must seek validation vertically, not horizontally. And as we do, we too can boldly proclaim, \u201cI am a child of God.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168178407\" id=\"p_zpzl0\">In a worldwide devotional for young adults, our beloved President Russell M. Nelson taught: \u201cSo who are you? First and foremost, you are a child of God, a child of the covenant, and a disciple of Jesus Christ. As you embrace these truths, our Heavenly Father will help you reach your ultimate goal of living eternally in His holy presence.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"6\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168178409\" id=\"p_zpE1B\">It is no coincidence that in likely the most repeated scripture, God reminds us of our relationship with Him. Of all the names He could be identified by in the sacrament prayer, He has asked to be called \u201cGod, the Eternal Father.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"7\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168178410\" id=\"p_uBNlN\">As we come to truly know who we are, we will believe more strongly that our loving Heavenly Father has provided a plan for us to return to live with Him again. Elder Patrick Kearon taught: \u201cOur Father\u2019s beautiful plan, even His \u2018fabulous\u2019 plan, is designed to bring you home, <em>not<\/em> to keep you out. \u2026 God is in relentless pursuit of you.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"8\"><\/sup><\/a> Think about that for a moment\u2014our all-powerful, loving Father is in \u201crelentless pursuit of you.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168178413\" id=\"p_fLeET\">Regardless of where we are on our path of discipleship, our lives will fundamentally change if we better understand who we really are. May I suggest two ways in which we can deepen this understanding.<\/p>\n<section id=\"sec_orWgM\">\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"168178415\" id=\"p_nPkEb\">First, Prayer<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"168178418\" id=\"p_jSyhC\">As the Savior was beginning His mortal ministry, he was led into the wilderness to \u201cbe with God.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"9\"><\/sup><\/a> Perhaps we should shift our mindset away from simply saying our prayers to taking sufficient time to really commune with and \u201cbe with God\u201d each day.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168178421\" id=\"p_hlwPq\">I have found that the quality of my prayers improves as I take a few minutes to prepare to talk to my Father. The scriptures show us that this is a pattern that works. Whether it is Joseph Smith;<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"10\"><\/sup><\/a> Nephi, the son of Helaman;<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"11\"><\/sup><\/a> or Enos, all have some form of pondering and reflecting prior to their recorded communication with God. Enos said that his soul hungered as the words of his father sunk deep into his heart.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"12\"><\/sup><\/a> Each of these examples teaches us the need to spiritually prepare for our time each day to \u201cbe with God.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168178424\" id=\"p_bRwDq\">To the Nephites, the Savior instructed, \u201cWhen thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"13\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168178427\" id=\"p_vR447\">Whether it is in a closet or a bedroom, the principle is to find a place where you can be alone to pray, to allow your soul to be still, and to feel the promptings of the \u201cstill small voice.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note14\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"14\"><\/sup><\/a> We can prepare by pondering on the things that we are grateful for and the questions or concerns that we would like to bring to our Father. We should strive not to have a rote manner of prayer but to <i>talk<\/i> with our Father, out loud if possible.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168178429\" id=\"p_dRkbK\">I realize that in the chaos of our lives, when we are wrestling with toddlers or running between meetings, we may not have the luxury of quiet closets and thoughtful preparation\u2014but those silent, quick, and urgent prayers can be much more meaningful when we have made an effort to \u201cbe with God\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note15\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"15\"><\/sup><\/a> earlier in the day.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168178432\" id=\"p_hWMot\">There may be some who haven\u2019t prayed for a long time or others who haven\u2019t felt that their prayers are being heard. I promise you that your Heavenly Father knows you, loves you, and wants to hear from you. He wants to communicate with you. He wants you to remember who you are.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168178436\" id=\"p_z9Z50\">Elder Jeffrey R. Holland recently taught: \u201cHowever much you are praying, pray more. However hard you are praying, pray harder.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note16\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"16\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168178440\" id=\"p_arcxn\">In addition to increasing the frequency and fervency of our prayers, studying the Book of Mormon daily and worshipping in the temple will help prepare our minds for revelation. As we strive to improve our communication with our Heavenly Father, He will bless us to feel more profoundly that we are His children.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"sec_iOgYn\">\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"168178444\" id=\"p_ohthv\">Second, Come to Know That Jesus Is the Christ<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"168178449\" id=\"p_tUsHd\">The greatest manifestation of Heavenly Father\u2019s love for us as His children is the reality that He sent His Son, our own personal Savior, to help us come home. Therefore, we need to come to know Him.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168178451\" id=\"p_sRvcb\">Years ago, while serving as a stake president, I submitted a recommendation for a brother to serve as an ordinance worker in the temple. After explaining what a wonderful ordinance worker he would be, I inadvertently pressed \u201cDo not endorse,\u201d which submitted the recommendation. After unsuccessfully trying to recall the message, I called the temple president and said, \u201cI have made a horrible mistake.\u201d Without hesitation, this good temple president said, \u201cPresident Eyre, there is nothing that you have done that can\u2019t be forgiven and ultimately corrected.\u201d What a great truth. Indeed, Jesus Christ is \u201cmighty to save.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note17\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"17\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168178455\" id=\"p_nZDlJ\">In 2019 there was a profound change in the temple recommend questions. Previously, one question asked if you had a testimony of Jesus Christ\u2019s role as Savior and Redeemer. It now asks if you have a testimony of His role as <i>your<\/i> Savior and Redeemer. Jesus Christ\u2019s Atonement not only works for others; it works for you and for me. He is my Savior. He is your Savior. Individually. Only through Him can you and I return to be with our Father.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168178460\" id=\"p_rhtHq\">So, brothers and sisters, let us seek Him. Let us study His divine relationship with the Father and with each of us. Let us experience the song of redeeming love that comes personally to each one of us through our Redeemer as we repent.
