Perhaps they were hoping to see a miracle firsthand. The Savior \u201ctook the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the town\u201d to heal him privately. Initially, the healing seemed less than effective. The man \u201clooked up, and said, I see men as trees, walking.\u201d Jesus, compassionately, \u201cput his hands again upon his eyes, and made him look up.\u201d With that additional touch of the Savior\u2019s hands, the blind man now \u201csaw \u2026 clearly.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"1\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179420\" id=\"p_enq1o\">This is just one example of how the Savior\u2019s life is characterized by humble acts of service. He reminds us that He \u201ccame not to be ministered unto, but to minister\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"2\"><\/sup><\/a> and then invites us to follow His example by going the extra mile,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"3\"><\/sup><\/a> giving to those who ask of us,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"4\"><\/sup><\/a> and loving our neighbor.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"5\"><\/sup><\/a> When asked, \u201cWho is my neighbour?\u201d Christ shared the parable of the good Samaritan, with a charge to \u201cgo, and do thou likewise.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"6\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179429\" id=\"p_m8X8H\">Missionaries of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints are modern-day examples of the good Samaritan that Christ invites us to become. I would like to highlight those missionaries who are called to service assignments.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"7\"><\/sup><\/a> They are examples to us of how service (1) opens hearts to the gospel of Jesus Christ, (2) allows all of us to minister regardless of our circumstances, and (3) brings the power of Christ into our lives.<\/p>\n<section id=\"sec_gZy6f\">\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"168179434\" id=\"p_iejiz\">First, Service Opens Hearts to the Gospel of Jesus Christ<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"168179440\" id=\"p_bqdSR\">In about 91 BC, Ammon, a Book of Mormon missionary, introduced himself to King Lamoni by saying, \u201cI desire to dwell among this people for a time; \u2026 [and] I will be thy servant.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"8\"><\/sup><\/a> Because of his service to the king, Ammon was granted an opportunity to \u201cspeak boldly, \u2026 and tell [King Lamoni] \u2026 by what power\u201d he had performed his service.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"9\"><\/sup><\/a> In return, the king promised that \u201cwhatsoever [Ammon] desirest \u2026 [the king would] grant it.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"10\"><\/sup><\/a> Ammon\u2019s only request was that the king listen to the message of the gospel of Jesus Christ.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"11\"><\/sup><\/a> Ammon\u2019s service resulted in \u201cthousands of souls [brought] to repentance.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"12\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179443\" id=\"p_eLYCS\">In our day, service continues to lead others to the gospel. Sister Bevan was serving as a teaching missionary when she began experiencing health issues requiring her to return home for treatment. Instead of being released, she was able to continue serving as a service missionary from home.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"13\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179447\" id=\"p_xBsc3\">While visiting a park, Sister Bevan and a friend were prompted to talk to a mother with four young children, but they hesitated and the family drove away. The next day, they returned to the park, praying that this family would be there. Miraculously, the mother was sitting in the exact same spot as the day before. This time Sister Bevan and her friend approached the mother, got to know her, and discovered that she was in desperate need of temporal help. They provided assistance and then invited her to learn about the gospel.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179452\" id=\"p_efWzZ\">Because of that service and invitation, the mother and her oldest child were baptized, followed by the next oldest a year later. They remain active members today. Sister Bevan knew this experience was divinely inspired, and it \u201cproved to [her] that [she] was exactly where God needed [her] to be.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note14\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"14\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179458\" id=\"p_wg9U9\">Like Ammon and Sister Bevan, as we serve others, we \u201cshow forth good examples unto them\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note15\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"15\"><\/sup><\/a> and they desire to know the \u201creason of the hope that is in [us].\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note16\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"16\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179464\" id=\"p_v5URg\">Jesus invites us to \u201cgo, and do thou likewise.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"sec_mX3vQ\">\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"168179468\" id=\"p_bLqKA\">Second, Service Allows All of Us to Minister Regardless of Our Circumstances<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"168179474\" id=\"p_bYIN7\">President Russell M. Nelson called on \u201c<em>every<\/em> worthy, able young man to prepare for and serve a mission\u201d and for every able young sister to \u201cpray to know if the Lord would have [her] serve a mission.\u201d He promised that \u201cyour decision to serve a mission, whether a proselyting or a service mission, will bless you and many others.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note17\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"17\"><\/sup><\/a> Service missions changed the definition of the word <i>able<\/i>.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note18\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"18\"><\/sup><\/a> Now every worthy young man and woman who desires to serve a full-time mission for the Lord can do so, with very few exceptions.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179478\" id=\"p_vJirW\">Elder Holgado is an example of being able to serve regardless of personal circumstances. He was born with a rare genetic disorder,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note19\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"19\"><\/sup><\/a> which precluded him from serving a teaching mission. Elder Holgado was called as a service missionary and volunteered in the bishops\u2019 storehouse, where he helped others get the assistance they needed. He stocked shelves, bagged vegetables, and crushed cardboard boxes.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"168179482\" id=\"p_rL11Z\">As Elder Holgado spoke in sacrament meeting after his mission, he shared that \u201cGod needs service missionaries. He needs people to love and serve others.

Consecrated service brought that power into his life. He said, \u201cI felt that when I was struggling, I could feel Christ lifting me up.

With another nine missions in the world, we were given the privilege of participating in a pilot project that incorporated young service missionaries into our mission. After our first meeting, I wrote in my journal: \u201cTonight we had a very special meeting. We met over 140 new missionaries in our mission and their parents. The chapel and gym were filled to capacity, and we held a Spirit-filled, energetic meeting to welcome the service missionaries into the Utah Orem Mission. I was overwhelmed by the feeling of love that we have for them. All are willing to serve. It was a beautiful sight.\u201d The circumstances of these missionaries extended from former teaching missionaries recovering from injuries to nonspeaking missionaries using wheelchairs. After that meeting, Sister Evanson said to me, \u201cNow our mission feels complete.\u201d<\/p>"
