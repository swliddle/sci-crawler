We can\u2019t be salt on our own; if we are to be salt of the earth, we must be bonded to the Lord, and that is what I see as I mingle with members of the Church around the world\u2014I see faithful members of the Church bonded to the Lord, committed in their efforts to serve others and be the salt of the earth.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704747\" id=\"p_wjuZO\">Your unwavering dedication is a shining example. Your service is appreciated and cherished.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704752\" id=\"p_tBFqd\">Our youth have shown remarkable courage and devotion. They have enthusiastically embraced the work of family history, and their frequent visits to the house of the Lord are a testament to their dedication. Their willingness to devote time and energy to serve missions across the globe reflects a deep and abiding faith. They are not merely participating but leading the way in becoming disciples bonded to Jesus Christ. Their service radiates light and hope, touching countless lives. To you, the youth of the Church, we express our heartfelt thanks for your inspiring service. You are not just the Church\u2019s future but its present. And you are indeed the salt of the earth!<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704757\" id=\"p_fw2cZ\">I love the Lord Jesus Christ and feel blessed by the opportunity to serve alongside you in the Lord\u2019s Church. Our unity and strength, grounded in our shared faith, reassure us that we are never alone in this journey. Together, we can continue to build the kingdom of God, rooted in service, love, and unwavering faith.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704762\" id=\"p_qZ6Lm\">When Jesus Christ taught by the Sea of Galilee, He often used everyday elements familiar to His audience to convey profound spiritual truths. One such element was salt. Jesus declared, \u201c[You] are the salt of the earth,\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"2\"> <\/sup><\/a>a statement rich in meaning and significance, especially for the people of His time, who understood the multifaceted value of salt.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704767\" id=\"p_aFRAY\">The ancient craft of salt harvesting in the Algarve, the southern region of my home country of Portugal, dates back thousands of years to the era of the Roman Empire. Remarkably, the methods used by the salt workers, known as <i>marnotos<\/i>, have changed little since then. These dedicated artisans employ traditional techniques, performing their work entirely by hand, maintaining a legacy that has endured through the centuries.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704773\" id=\"p_qpHZL\">This ancient method harvests what is called \u201cflower of salt.\u201d To fully appreciate the intricate process of harvesting the flower of salt, it is essential to understand the environment in which it is produced. The Algarve\u2019s coastal salt marshes provide the ideal conditions for salt production. Seawater is channeled into shallow ponds, known as salt pans, where it is left to evaporate under the intense sun. As the water evaporates, the flower of salt forms delicate crystals on the surface of the salt pans. These crystals are incredibly pure and have a unique, crisp texture. The <i>marnotos<\/i> carefully skim the crystals from the water\u2019s surface using specialized tools, a process that requires great skill and precision. In Portugal, this fine-quality salt is referred to as \u201csalt cream\u201d because it can be gently skimmed away like cream rising to the top of milk. This delicate salt is cherished for its purity and exceptional flavor, making it a prized ingredient in culinary arts.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704779\" id=\"p_kq7tj\">Just like the <i>marnotos<\/i> put forth great effort to ensure they harvest the highest quality of salt, so should we, as the Lord\u2019s covenant people, always do our very best so that our love and example are, as much as possible, a pure reflection of our Savior, Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704783\" id=\"p_bhdjA\">In the ancient world, salt was more than just a seasoning\u2014it was a vital preservative and a symbol of purity and covenant. People knew that salt was essential for preserving food and enhancing flavor. They also understood the grave implications of salt losing its saltiness, or savor, by becoming contaminated or diluted.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704791\" id=\"p_vzJ5f\">Like salt can lose its essence, we can also lose our spiritual vitality if our faith in Jesus Christ becomes casual. We may look the same on the outside, but without a strong inner faith, we lose our ability to make a difference in the world and bring out the best in those around us.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704798\" id=\"p_kwL2K\">So how can we channel our energy and efforts to make a difference and be the change the world needs today? How can we preserve discipleship and continue to be a positive influence?<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704806\" id=\"p_iO48X\">The words of our dear prophet still echo in my mind: \u201cGod wants us to work together and help each other. That is why He sends us to earth in families and organizes us into wards and stakes. That is why He asks us to serve and minister to each other. That is why He asks us to live <i>in<\/i> the world but not be <i>of<\/i> the world.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"3\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704814\" id=\"p_w735D\">When our lives are filled with purpose and service, we avoid spiritual apathy; on the other hand, when our lives are deprived of divine purpose, meaningful service to others, and sacred opportunities for pondering and reflection, we gradually become suffocated by our own activity and self-interest, risking losing our savor. The antidote to this is to continue to be involved in service\u2014being anxiously engaged in good works and the betterment of ourselves and the society we live in.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704822\" id=\"p_y9bbB\">My dear brothers and sisters, what a blessing we all have today to belong to the Church of Jesus Christ and have the opportunity to serve in His Church. Our circumstances may vary, but we all can make a difference.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704830\" id=\"p_nGfvQ\">Remember the <i>marnotos<\/i>, the salt workers; they use simple tools to harvest the best crystals, the best salt! We too can do simple things that, with consistent efforts in small and meaningful acts, can deepen our discipleship and commitment to Jesus Christ. Here are four simple yet profound ways we can strive to be the salt of the earth:<\/p>\n<ol class=\"decimal\" start=\"1\">\n<li data-marker=\"1.\">\n<p data-aid=\"162704837\" id=\"p_xNbcO\">Keeping the house of the Lord at the center of our devotion. Now that temples are closer than ever before, prioritizing regular worship in the house of the Lord will help us focus on what matters most and keep our lives centered in Christ. In the temple, we find the heart of our faith in Jesus Christ and the soul of our devotion to Him.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"2.\">\n<p data-aid=\"162704845\" id=\"p_zQjCe\">Being deliberate in our efforts to strengthen others by living the gospel together. We can strengthen our families through consistent and intentional efforts to bring gospel principles into our lives and to our homes.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"3.\">\n<p data-aid=\"162704853\" id=\"p_sm5tE\">Being willing to accept a calling and serving in the Church. Service in our local congregations allows us to support one another and grow together. While serving is not always convenient, it is always rewarding.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"4.\">\n<p data-aid=\"162704862\" id=\"p_zP6wn\">And finally, using digital communication tools with purpose. Today, digital communication tools allow us to connect as never before. Like most of you, I use these tools to connect with brothers and sisters in the Church and with my family and friends. As I connect with them, I feel closer to them; we can minister to each other in times of need when we cannot be physically present. These tools are undoubtedly a blessing, yet these very same tools can drag us away from the depth of meaningful interactions and eventually cause us to be pulled into habits that waste our time in less purposeful activities. Striving to be the salt of the earth includes so much more than an endless scrolling of reels on a six-inch (15 cm) screen.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p data-aid=\"162704872\" id=\"p_jhUui\">As we keep the house of the Lord central in our lives, intentionally strengthen others by living the gospel, accept callings to serve, and use digital tools with purpose, we can preserve our spiritual vitality. Just as salt in its purest form has the power to enhance and preserve, so too does our faith in Jesus Christ when it is nourished and protected by our dedication to Christlike service and love.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704882\" id=\"p_jjGs5\">As we remain bonded to the Lord, our lives will naturally reflect His light, and we will become the salt of the earth. In this effort, we not only enrich our lives but also strengthen our families and our communities. May we strive to maintain this bond with the Lord, never lose our savor, and be the small, little crystal of salt that the Lord wants us to be. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<footer class=\"notes\">\n<p class=\"title\" data-aid=\"162704892\" id=\"p_jbSWS\">Notes<\/p>\n<ol class=\"decimal\" data-type=\"marker\" start=\"1\">\n<li data-marker=\"1.\" id=\"note1\" data-full-marker=\"1.\">\n<p data-aid=\"162704903\" id=\"p_xaBAX\"><a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101?lang=eng&amp;id=p39#p39\">Doctrine and Covenants 101:39<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"2.\" id=\"note2\" data-full-marker=\"2.\">\n<p data-aid=\"162704911\" id=\"p_kIVdW\"><a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/nt/matt/5?lang=eng&amp;id=p13#p13\">Matthew 5:13<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"3.\" id=\"note3\" data-full-marker=\"3.\">\n<p data-aid=\"162704924\" id=\"p_qC0wA\">Russell M.
