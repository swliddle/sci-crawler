It marks 75 years since I was baptized and confirmed a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Zwickau, Germany.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"1\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162706154\" id=\"p_rns86\">My membership in the Church of Jesus Christ is precious to me. To be counted among God\u2019s covenant people, with you, my brothers and sisters, is one of the greatest honors of my life.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162706163\" id=\"p_aUI7P\">When I think about my personal journey of discipleship, my mind often goes back to an old villa in Zwickau, where I have cherished memories of attending sacrament meetings of the Church of Jesus Christ as a child. It is there where the seedling of my testimony received its earliest nourishing.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"2\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162706170\" id=\"p_omJEW\">This chapel had an old air-driven organ. Every Sunday a young man was assigned to push up and down the sturdy lever operating the bellows to make the organ work. I sometimes had the great privilege of assisting in this important task.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162706177\" id=\"p_kic42\">While the congregation sang our beloved hymns, I pumped with all my strength so the organ would not run out of wind. From the bellows operator seat, I had a great view of some stunning stained-glass windows, one depicting the Savior Jesus Christ and another portraying Joseph Smith in the Sacred Grove.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162706183\" id=\"p_uJi7H\">I can still remember the sacred feelings I had as I looked at those sunlit windows while listening to the testimonies of the Saints and singing the hymns of Zion.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162706190\" id=\"p_tVzl1\">In that holy place, the Spirit of God bore witness to my mind and heart that it was true: Jesus Christ is the Savior of the world. This is His Church. The Prophet Joseph Smith saw God the Father and Jesus Christ and heard Their voices.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162706197\" id=\"p_tWQnr\">Earlier this year, while on assignment in Europe, I had the opportunity to return to Zwickau. Sadly, that beloved old chapel isn\u2019t there anymore. It was torn down many years ago to make room for a large apartment building.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"sec_rM6T0\">\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"162706205\" id=\"p_eKx84\">What Is Eternal, and What Is Not?<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"162706212\" id=\"p_twS6J\">I admit that it\u2019s sad to know that this beloved building from my childhood is now just a memory. It was a sacred building to me. But it was just a building.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162706218\" id=\"p_zSrp3\">By contrast, the spiritual witness I gained from the Holy Ghost those many years ago has not passed away. In fact, it has grown stronger. The things I learned in my youth about the fundamental principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ have been my firm foundation throughout my life. The covenant connection I forged with my Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son has stayed with me\u2014long after the Zwickau chapel was dismantled and the stained-glass windows were lost.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162706225\" id=\"p_adL6P\">\u201cHeaven and earth shall pass away,\u201d Jesus said, \u201cbut my words shall not pass away.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"3\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162706233\" id=\"p_lckvi\">\u201cThe mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but my kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the covenant of my peace be removed, saith the Lord.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"4\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162706240\" id=\"p_lpY6a\">One of the most important things we can learn in this life is the difference between what is eternal and what is not.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"5\"><\/sup><\/a> Once we understand that, everything changes\u2014our relationships, the choices we make, the way we treat people.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162706248\" id=\"p_qrNt1\">Knowing what is eternal and what is not is key to growing a testimony of Jesus Christ and His Church.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"sec_xh6Mo\">\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"162706256\" id=\"p_rKQRz\">Don\u2019t Mistake the Branches for the Roots<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"162706263\" id=\"p_kLJnn\">The restored gospel of Jesus Christ, as the Prophet Joseph Smith taught, \u201cembrace[s] all, and every item of truth.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"6\"><\/sup><\/a> But that doesn\u2019t mean that all truth is of equal value. Some truths are core, essential, at the root of our faith. Others are appendages or branches\u2014valuable, but only when they are connected to the fundamentals.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162706271\" id=\"p_yaLIK\">The Prophet Joseph also said, \u201cThe fundamental principles of our religion are the testimony of the Apostles and Prophets, concerning Jesus Christ, that He died, was buried, and rose again the third day, and ascended into heaven; and all other things which pertain to our religion are only appendages to it.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"7\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162706279\" id=\"p_fLFYI\">In other words, Jesus Christ and His atoning sacrifice are the root of our testimony. All other things are branches.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162706284\" id=\"p_xI4d0\">This is not to say that the branches are unimportant. A tree needs branches. But as the Savior told His disciples, \u201cThe branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"8\"><\/sup><\/a> Without a connection to the Savior, to the nourishment found in the roots, a branch withers and dies.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162706295\" id=\"p_joNBS\">When it comes to nourishing our testimonies of Jesus Christ, I wonder if we sometimes mistake the branches for the roots. This was the mistake Jesus observed in the Pharisees of His day. They paid so much attention to the relatively minor details of the law that they ended up neglecting what the Savior called \u201cthe weightier matters\u201d\u2014fundamental principles like \u201cjustice and mercy and faith.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"9\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162706304\" id=\"p_k19wP\">If you want to nourish a tree, you don\u2019t splash water on the branches. You water the roots. Similarly, if you want the branches of your testimony to grow and bear fruit, nourish the roots. If you are uncertain about a particular doctrine or practice or element of Church history, seek clarity with faith in Jesus Christ. Seek to understand His sacrifice for you, His love for you, His will for you. Follow Him in humility. The branches of your testimony will draw strength from your deepening faith in Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162706312\" id=\"p_heNHh\">For example, if you want a stronger testimony of the Book of Mormon, focus on its witness of Jesus Christ.

These circumstances are certainly important to grow the Church.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162706387\" id=\"p_rr6FO\">Nevertheless, if the roots of our testimony never grow deeper than that, what will happen when we move to a ward that meets in a less impressive building, with members who aren\u2019t so friendly, and the bishop says something that offends us?<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162706395\" id=\"p_gjx1u\">Another example: Doesn\u2019t it seem reasonable to hope that if we keep the commandments and are sealed in the temple, we will be blessed with a large, happy family with bright, obedient children, all of whom stay active in the Church, serve missions, sing in the ward choir, and volunteer to help clean the meetinghouse every Saturday morning?<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162706402\" id=\"p_ovy15\">I certainly hope that all of us will see this in our lives. But what if it doesn\u2019t happen? Will we stay bound to the Savior regardless of circumstances\u2014trusting Him and His timing?<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162706410\" id=\"p_iGvxl\">We must ask ourselves: Is my testimony based on what I hope to happen in my life?

It can be. Is it helpful to learn from the accounts of scribes and others about the details of how Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon? It is for some. But none of this constitutes a lasting testimony that the Book of Mormon is the word of God. For that, you need to find the Savior in the Book of Mormon, to hear His voice speaking to you. Once this happens, it won\u2019t matter to you where the ancient city of Zarahemla was actually located or what the Urim and Thummim looked like.
