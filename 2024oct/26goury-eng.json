I vividly remember the preacher\u2019s call to his congregation to cleanse their clothes in preparation for the Savior\u2019s arrival. Being young, I took this call literally. I ran home as fast as my little legs could carry me and begged my mother to clean my few clothes so that I could be spotless and ready for the Savior\u2019s coming the next day. Although my mother was skeptical about the Savior\u2019s imminent return, she still washed my best outfit.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705574\" id=\"p_dWMDf\">The next morning, I put on the still slightly damp clothing and eagerly waited for the announcement of the Savior\u2019s arrival. As the day wore on and nothing happened, I decided to go to the meetinghouse. I was deeply disappointed to find that the church was empty and the Savior had not arrived. You can imagine my feelings as I slowly walked home.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705577\" id=\"p_msGJg\">Years later, as I was receiving the missionary lessons in preparation to join The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I read the following: \u201cAnd no unclean thing can enter into his kingdom; therefore nothing entereth into his rest save it be those who have washed their garments in my blood, because of their faith, and the repentance of all their sins, and their faithfulness unto the end.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"1\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705580\" id=\"p_gBJkv\">The clarification I received at that time helped me to understand the important truth that had eluded my young mind many years prior. The preacher\u2019s message was centered on the importance of spiritual purity. He urged the congregation to seek repentance, make changes in their lives, and turn to the Savior for redemption.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705584\" id=\"p_nRRlc\">Our Heavenly Father understands our mortal journey and the inevitability of sin in our lives. I am deeply thankful that He has provided a Savior to atone for our transgressions. Through the Savior\u2019s redemptive sacrifice, each of us can repent and seek forgiveness and become clean. Repentance, a foundational principle of the gospel, is essential for our spiritual development and resilience as we navigate life\u2019s challenges.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705590\" id=\"p_tpJoH\">During the April 2022 general conference, President Russell M. Nelson invited every member of the Church to experience the joy of daily repentance. He said:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705594\" id=\"p_jVKbd\">\u201cPlease do not fear or delay repenting. Satan delights in your misery. Cut it short. Cast his influence out of your life! Start today to experience the joy of putting off the natural man. The Savior loves us always but <em>especially<\/em> when we repent. \u2026<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705598\" id=\"p_lkySk\">\u201cIf you feel you have strayed off the covenant path too far or too long and have no way to return, that simply is not true.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"2\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705604\" id=\"p_lA3re\">If there is something that you have not fully repented of, I encourage you to heed President Nelson\u2019s call not to procrastinate your repentance. It may require some courage to engage in this process; however, I can assure you that the joy that emanates from genuine repentance surpasses understanding. Through repentance, our burdens of guilt are lifted and replaced with a sense of peace and tranquility. As we repent earnestly, we are sanctified through the Savior\u2019s blood, increasing our sensitivity to the promptings and influence of the Holy Ghost.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705608\" id=\"p_fhu1J\">My eternal companion was born with a hearing impairment and as a result must wear hearing aids. Dust and sweat can affect the performance of these devices, and so each morning I observe her diligently cleaning the connecting tubes before wearing the aids. This simple yet consistent routine eliminates any dirt, moisture, or condensation, thereby improving her ability to hear and communicate effectively. When she overlooks this daily ritual, her ability to hear suffers throughout the day; spoken words gradually fade and eventually become inaudible. Just as her daily hearing aid cleaning allows her to hear clearly, daily repentance allows us to discern the guidance of the Lord through the Holy Ghost.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705613\" id=\"p_dnO1c\">Near the end of the Lord\u2019s mortal ministry and before His departure to the Garden of Gethsemane, He prepared His disciples to face the upcoming trials. He assured them, saying, \u201cBut the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"3\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705618\" id=\"p_m28FE\">One of the Holy Ghost\u2019s essential functions is to caution, lead, and guide every individual who listens to the soft, inner voice. Just as the blocked communication tubes of a hearing aid can hinder proper functionality, our spiritual connection with our Heavenly Father can also be impaired, leading to dangerous misconceptions or a failure to heed His counsel. The advent of the internet has made information more accessible than ever before. This can lead us to turn to the world for guidance rather than to God. President Russell M. Nelson taught, \u201cIn coming days, it will not be possible to survive spiritually without the guiding, directing, comforting, and constant influence of the Holy Ghost.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"4\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705625\" id=\"p_a8Ckv\">I am grateful that each of us can receive the gift of the Holy Ghost at the time of our confirmation. However, President Dallin H. Oaks warned that \u201cthe blessings available through the gift of the Holy Ghost are conditioned upon worthiness [and] \u2018the Spirit of the Lord doth not dwell in unholy temples\u2019 [<a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/4?lang=eng&amp;id=p24#p24\">Helaman 4:24<\/a>].\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"5\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705630\" id=\"p_yb9XD\">When we consciously choose to follow the guidance of prophets and apostles, our capacity to have the Holy Ghost as a constant companion grows. The Holy Ghost provides clarity in decision-making, prompting thoughts and impressions that align with our Heavenly Father\u2019s will. Having the Holy Ghost as a constant companion is crucial for our spiritual growth.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705634\" id=\"p_omgRl\">I was recently assigned to preside over a stake conference at the Salt Lake Granger West Stake in Utah. During this event, I met a stake president who has diligently developed his ability to discern the promptings of the Holy Ghost through righteous living and daily repentance. As part of our ministering efforts, we coordinated visits to three households. Upon completing our final visit, we found ourselves with approximately 30 minutes remaining before our next engagement. As we traveled back to the stake center, President Chesnut received an impression to visit one additional family. We both agreed to follow this prompting.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705637\" id=\"p_tORZm\">We proceeded to visit the Jones family,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"6\"><\/sup><\/a> where we discovered Sister Jones confined to bed due to illness. It was apparent that she needed a priesthood blessing. With her permission, we administered to her. As we prepared to depart, Sister Jones asked how we knew of her urgent need for a blessing. The truth is, <em>we<\/em> didn\u2019t know. However, our Heavenly Father, who was aware of her needs, <em>did<\/em> know and inspired President Chesnut to visit her home. When we are receptive to the guidance of the still, small voice, we are better equipped to more effectively minister to those in need.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705643\" id=\"p_nOb2n\">I testify of a kind and loving Heavenly Father. Jesus Christ is the Savior and Redeemer of mankind. I testify that the Atonement of Jesus Christ is real and that as we learn to follow the guidance of the Holy Ghost, He will lead us to repent and use the power of the Savior\u2019s Atonement in our lives. President Russell M. Nelson is the true and living prophet of the Lord, with all priesthood keys on the earth today. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<footer class=\"notes\">\n<p class=\"title\" data-aid=\"162705651\" id=\"p_zYK4k\">Notes<\/p>\n<ol class=\"decimal\" data-type=\"marker\" start=\"1\">\n<li data-marker=\"1.\" id=\"note1\" data-full-marker=\"1.\">\n<p data-aid=\"162705658\" id=\"p_fu7lR\"><a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27?lang=eng&amp;id=p19#p19\">3 Nephi 27:19<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"2.\" id=\"note2\" data-full-marker=\"2.\">\n<p data-aid=\"162705664\" id=\"p_zrgl8\">Russell M.
