It draws us closer and happier to the Lord and each other.<\/p>\n<\/header>\n<div class=\"body-block\">\n<p data-aid=\"162704841\" id=\"p_knWwU\">Our recent Gong family reunion included a fun talent show, complete with a dad jokes contest.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704849\" id=\"p_q1Syn\">But this contest was unusual. On one team was Grandpa (me) and two of the grandchildren, ages 12 and 11. On the other team was an artificial intelligence (AI) program prompted by a cousin to tell dad jokes in the style of Gerrit W. Gong. Grandpa Gerrit Gong versus AI Gerrit Gong.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704857\" id=\"p_gxoEq\">The grandchildren and I went first.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704866\" id=\"p_wC2Pq\">What do you call a dinosaur who crashes his car? Tyrannosaurus Wrecks.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704876\" id=\"p_eEo4B\">AI Gerrit Gong was instructed\u2014think like Gerrit W. Gong. Talk like him.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704886\" id=\"p_sNAYG\">AI Gerrit Gong\u2014\u201cHere is a dad joke as if spoken by Gerrit W. Gong, embracing his warm, thoughtful, and uplifting style: Why did the humble tree make people smile? Because it was rooted in love and reached out with branches of kindness. Like that tree, we too can find strength in our roots and joy in extending kindness to others.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704896\" id=\"p_c3Y7s\">Well, what do you think? That\u2019s why they\u2019re called dad jokes.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704907\" id=\"p_rgs02\">All around us are opportunities to laugh, delight, see with grateful eyes. Ours is a gospel of joy and holiness in everyday life. Holiness sets things apart for sacred purpose. But holiness also invites us to infuse daily living with the sacred\u2014to rejoice in daily bread amidst this world\u2019s thistles and thorns. To walk with the Lord, we must become holy, for He is holy,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"1\"><\/sup><\/a> and to help us become holy, the Lord invites us to walk with Him.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"2\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704918\" id=\"p_lr8ZX\">We each have a story. As Sister Gong and I meet you\u2014Church members and friends in many places and circumstances\u2014your stories of holiness to the Lord in everyday life inspire us. You live seven Cs: <strong>c<\/strong>ommunion with God, <strong>c<\/strong>ommunity and <strong>c<\/strong>ompassion with each other, <strong>c<\/strong>ommitment and <strong>c<\/strong>ovenant with God, family, and friends\u2014<strong>c<\/strong>entered in Jesus <strong>C<\/strong>hrist.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704930\" id=\"p_cNKiw\">Growing evidence highlights this striking fact: religious believers are on average happier, healthier, and more fulfilled than those without spiritual commitment or connection. Happiness and life satisfaction, mental and physical health, meaning and purpose, character and virtue, close social relationships, even financial and material stability\u2014on each measure, religious practitioners flourish.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"3\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704939\" id=\"p_zizPX\">They enjoy better physical and mental health and greater life satisfaction across all ages and demographic groups.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704948\" id=\"p_f8HDw\">What researchers call \u201creligious structural stability\u201d offers clarity, purpose, and inspiration amidst life\u2019s twists and turns. The household of faith and community of Saints combat isolation and the lonely crowd. Holiness to the Lord says no to the profane, no to snarky cleverness at others\u2019 expense, no to algorithms that monetize anger and polarization. Holiness to the Lord says yes to the sacred and reverent, yes to our becoming our freest, happiest, most authentic, best selves as we follow Him in faith.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704957\" id=\"p_jKoY2\">What does holiness to the Lord in everyday life look like?<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704966\" id=\"p_f9K3b\">Holiness to the Lord in everyday life looks like two faithful young adults, married for a year, sharing with authenticity and vulnerability gospel covenants, sacrifice, and service in their unfolding lives.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"4\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704975\" id=\"p_xk7nv\">She begins, \u201cIn high school, I was in a dark place. I felt like God wasn\u2019t there for me. One night, a text from a friend said, \u2018Hey, have you read <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/36?lang=eng\">Alma 36<\/a> ever?\u2019<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704983\" id=\"p_x7jh2\">\u201cAs I started reading,\u201d she said, \u201cI was overcome with peace and love. I felt like I was being given this big hug. When I read <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/36?lang=eng&amp;id=p12#p12\">Alma 36:12<\/a>, I knew Heavenly Father saw me and knew exactly how I was feeling.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704991\" id=\"p_hjsxV\">She continues, \u201cBefore we got married, I was honest with my fiancé that I didn\u2019t have a great testimony of tithing. Why did God need us to give money when others had so much to give? My fiancé helped explain it\u2019s not about money but following a commandment asked of us. He challenged me to start paying tithing.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704999\" id=\"p_goeS1\">\u201cI really saw my testimony grow,\u201d she said. \u201cSometimes money gets tight, but we saw so many blessings, and somehow paychecks were enough.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705008\" id=\"p_vDfHh\">Also, \u201cin my nursing class,\u201d she said, \u201cI was the only member of the Church and the only one married. Many times I left class frustrated or crying because I felt classmates singled me out and made negative comments about my beliefs, my wearing my garments, or my being married so young.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705015\" id=\"p_mFWYD\">Yet she continues, \u201cThis past semester I learned how to better voice my beliefs and be a good gospel example. My knowledge and testimony grew because I was tested in my ability to stand alone and be strong in what I believe.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705023\" id=\"p_xvlh5\">The young husband adds, \u201cBefore my mission I had offers to play college baseball. Making the difficult decision, I put those offers aside and went to serve the Lord. I wouldn\u2019t trade those two years for anything.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705031\" id=\"p_hfXN7\">\u201cReturning home,\u201d he said, \u201cI expected a difficult transition but found myself stronger, faster, and healthier. I was throwing harder than when I left. I had more offers to play than when I left, including my dream school. And, most importantly,\u201d he said, \u201cI rely upon the Lord more than ever.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705039\" id=\"p_t1X5k\">He concludes, \u201cAs a missionary I taught that Heavenly Father promises us power in our prayers, but sometimes I forget that for myself.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"5\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705047\" id=\"p_pE6af\">Our treasury of missionary holiness-to-the-Lord blessings is rich and full.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"6\"><\/sup><\/a> Finances, timing, and other circumstances are often not easy. But when missionaries of all ages and backgrounds consecrate holiness to the Lord, things can work out in the Lord\u2019s time and way.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705054\" id=\"p_imNUb\">Now with a 48-year perspective, a senior missionary shares, \u201cMy dad wanted me to get a college education, not go on a mission. Shortly after that, he had a heart attack and died at age 47. I felt guilty. How could I make things right with my father?<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705091\" id=\"p_qJoOA\">\u201cLater,\u201d he continues, \u201cafter I decided to serve a mission, I saw my father in a dream. Peaceful and contented, he was happy I would serve.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705097\" id=\"p_vPCKR\">This senior missionary continues, \u201cAs <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/138?lang=eng\">Doctrine and Covenants section 138<\/a> teaches, I believe my father could serve as a missionary in the spirit world. I picture my father helping our great-grandfather, who left Germany at age 17 and was lost to the family, be found again.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705104\" id=\"p_b5Cfa\">His wife adds, \u201cAmong the five brothers in my husband\u2019s family, the four who served missions are the ones with college degrees.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705111\" id=\"p_ioKo7\">Holiness to the Lord in everyday life looks like a young returning missionary who learned to let God prevail in his life. Earlier, when asked to bless someone who was very sick, this missionary said, \u201cI have faith; I will bless him to recover. Yet,\u201d the returning missionary says, \u201cI learned in that moment to pray not for what I wanted but for what the Lord knew the person needed. I blessed the brother with peace and comfort. He later passed away peacefully.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705118\" id=\"p_vCXGc\">Holiness to the Lord in everyday life feels like a spark arcing across the veil to connect, comfort, and strengthen. An administrator at a major university says he feels individuals he knows only by reputation praying for him. Those individuals devoted their lives to the university and continue to care about its mission and students.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705125\" id=\"p_wYFNY\">A sister does her best each day, after her husband was unfaithful to her and the children. I deeply admire her and others like her. One day while folding laundry, her hand on a stack of garments, she sighed to herself, \u201cWhat\u2019s the point?\u201d She felt a tender voice assure her, \u201cYour covenants are with me.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"7\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705132\" id=\"p_it056\">For 50 years, another sister yearned for a relationship with her father.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"8\"><\/sup><\/a> \u201cGrowing up,\u201d she says, \u201cthere were my brothers and my dad, and then there was me\u2014the only daughter. All I ever wanted was to be \u2018good enough\u2019 for my dad.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705140\" id=\"p_hEw0Z\">\u201cThen my mom passed away! She was my only liaison between my dad and me.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705147\" id=\"p_npG6t\">\u201cOne day,\u201d the sister said, \u201cI heard a voice say, \u2018Invite your dad and take him to the temple with you.\u2019 That was the beginning of a twice-a-month date with my daddy to the house of the Lord. I told my dad I loved him. He told me he loved me too.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705154\" id=\"p_pJi3R\">\u201cSpending time in the house of the Lord has healed us. My mom could not help us on earth. It took her being on the other side of the veil to help mend what was broken. The temple completed our journey to wholeness as an eternal family.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705161\" id=\"p_hgq6R\">The father says, \u201cThe temple dedication was a great spiritual experience for me and my only daughter. Now we attend together and feel our love strengthen.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705168\" id=\"p_ab8K4\">Holiness to the Lord in everyday life includes tender moments when loved ones pass. Earlier this year, my dear mother, Jean Gong, slipped into the next life days before her 98th birthday.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"9\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705175\" id=\"p_kT3NF\">If you asked my mother, \u201cWould you like rocky road, white chocolate ginger, or strawberry ice cream?\u201d Mom would say, \u201cYes, please, may I taste each one?\u201d Who could say no to your mother, especially when she loved all of life\u2019s flavors?<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705182\" id=\"p_gDp7I\">I once asked Mom which decisions had most shaped her life.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705189\" id=\"p_ynkbC\">She said, \u201cBeing baptized a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and moving from Hawaii to the mainland, where I met your father.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705195\" id=\"p_sL2Zh\">Baptized as a 15-year-old, the only member of her large family to join our Church, my mother had covenant faith and trust in the Lord that blessed her life and all our family generations. I miss my mother, as you miss members in your family. But I know my mother is not gone. She is just not here now. I honor her and all who pass as valiant examples of everyday holiness to the Lord.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705201\" id=\"p_vcCjr\">Of course, holiness to the Lord in everyday life includes coming more often to the Lord in His holy house.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"10\"><\/sup><\/a> This is true whether we are Church members or friends.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705207\" id=\"p_gHF9L\">Three friends came to the Bangkok Thailand Temple open house.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705213\" id=\"p_u2bKc\">\u201cThis is a place of super healing,\u201d said one.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705219\" id=\"p_cd4VW\">In the baptistry, another said, \u201cWhen I am here, I want to be washed clean and never sin again.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705225\" id=\"p_ae6JJ\">The third said, \u201cCan you feel the spiritual power?\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705231\" id=\"p_gu64e\">With nine sacred words, our temples invite and proclaim:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705237\" id=\"p_fzyEO\">\u201cHoliness to the Lord.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705242\" id=\"p_iOEXI\">\u201cThe House of the Lord.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"11\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705247\" id=\"p_o6laE\">Holiness to the Lord makes daily living sacred. It draws us closer and happier to the Lord and each other and prepares us to live with God our Father, Jesus Christ, and our loved ones.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705251\" id=\"p_xjdv2\">As did my friend, you may wonder if your Heavenly Father loves you. The answer is a resounding, absolute yes! We can feel His love as we make holiness to the Lord ours each day, happy and forever.
