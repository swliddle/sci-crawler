Renlund<\/p>\n<p class=\"author-role\" data-aid=\"162704665\" id=\"p_dzH1Q\">Of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"kicker\" data-aid=\"162704667\" id=\"p_oCnBB\">This is the Savior\u2019s gospel, and this is His Church (see <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/27?lang=eng&amp;id=p21#p21\">3 Nephi 27:21<\/a>; <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/26?lang=eng&amp;id=p22#p22\">Mosiah 26:22<\/a>; <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/27?lang=eng&amp;id=p13#p13\">27:13<\/a>). The combination of the two is powerful and transformative.<\/p>\n<\/header>\n<div class=\"body-block\">\n<p data-aid=\"162704669\" id=\"p_lVHPH\">For centuries, black powder was the most powerful explosive available.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"1\"><\/sup><\/a> It could launch cannon balls, but it wasn\u2019t effective for most mining and road construction projects. It was just too weak to shatter rock.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704671\" id=\"p_v78DC\">In 1846 an Italian chemist named Ascanio Sobrero synthesized a new explosive, nitroglycerin. This oily fluid was at least a thousand times more powerful than black powder. It could easily shatter rock. Unfortunately, nitroglycerin was unstable. If you dropped it from a small height, it\u2019d blow up. If it got too hot, it\u2019d blow up. If it got too cold, it\u2019d blow up. Even placed in a cool, dark room and left alone, it\u2019d eventually blow up. Most countries banned its transportation, and many banned its manufacture.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704672\" id=\"p_qGryq\">In 1860 a Swedish scientist named Alfred Nobel began trying to stabilize nitroglycerin. After seven years of experimentation, he achieved his goal by absorbing nitroglycerin into a nearly worthless substance known as diatomaceous earth, or kieselguhr. Kieselguhr is a porous rock that can be crumbled into a fine powder. When mixed with nitroglycerin, kieselguhr absorbs the nitroglycerin, and the resultant paste can be shaped into \u201csticks.\u201d In this form, nitroglycerin was much more stable. It could be safely stored, transported, and used with undiminished explosive power. Nobel named the combination of nitroglycerin and kieselguhr \u201cdynamite.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704674\" id=\"p_sDWjE\">Dynamite changed the world.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"2\"><\/sup><\/a> It also made Nobel wealthy. Without a stabilizer, nitroglycerin was just too hazardous to be commercially valuable, as Ascanio Sobrero found out.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"3\"><\/sup><\/a> By itself, as I mentioned, kieselguhr was of little value.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"4\"><\/sup><\/a> But the combination of the two components made dynamite transformative and precious.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704676\" id=\"p_copYg\">In a similar way, the combination of the gospel of Jesus Christ<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"5\"><\/sup><\/a> and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints provides powerful and transformative benefits for us. The gospel is perfect, but a divinely commissioned church is required to preach it, maintain its purity, and administer its sacred ordinances with the Savior\u2019s power and authority.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704678\" id=\"p_dV8aw\">Consider the combination of the Savior\u2019s gospel and His Church as established by the Book of Mormon prophet Alma. The Church was responsible for preaching \u201cnothing save it were repentance and faith on the Lord, who [would redeem] his people.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"6\"><\/sup><\/a> Using God\u2019s authority, the Church was responsible for administering the ordinance of baptism \u201cin the name of the Lord, as a witness [of entering] into a covenant with him [to] serve him and keep his commandments.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"7\"><\/sup><\/a> The people who were baptized took on themselves the name of Jesus Christ,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"8\"><\/sup><\/a> joined His Church,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"9\"><\/sup><\/a> and were promised great power through an outpouring of the Spirit.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"10\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704680\" id=\"p_b5SIq\">People flocked to the Waters of Mormon to hear Alma preach the gospel. Though they revered those waters and the surrounding forests, the Lord\u2019s Church was not a location or a building, nor is it today. The Church is simply ordinary people, disciples of Jesus Christ, gathered and organized into a divinely appointed structure that helps the Lord accomplish His purposes. The Church is the instrument through which we learn the central role of Jesus Christ in Heavenly Father\u2019s plan. The Church offers the authoritative way for individuals to participate in ordinances and make lasting covenants with God.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"11\"><\/sup><\/a> Keeping those covenants draws us closer to God, gives us access to His power,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"12\"><\/sup><\/a> and transforms us into who He intends us to become.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"13\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704681\" id=\"p_sUs8r\">Just as dynamite without nitroglycerin is unremarkable, the Savior\u2019s Church is special only if it is built on His gospel.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note14\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"14\"><\/sup><\/a> Without the Savior\u2019s gospel and the authority to administer the ordinances thereof,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note15\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"15\"><\/sup><\/a> the Church isn\u2019t exceptional.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note16\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"16\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704684\" id=\"p_iJ1MR\">Without the stabilizing effect of kieselguhr, nitroglycerin had limited value as an explosive.

The combination of the Savior\u2019s gospel and His Church transforms our lives. It transformed my maternal grandparents. My grandfather Oskar Andersson worked in a shipyard on HÃ¶gmarsÃ¶, an island in the Stockholm archipelago. His wife, Albertina, and their children lived on the Swedish mainland. Once every two weeks, on Saturday, Oskar rowed his boat home for the weekend before returning to HÃ¶gmarsÃ¶ on Sunday evening. One day, while on HÃ¶gmarsÃ¶, he heard two American missionaries preach the restored gospel of Jesus Christ. Oskar felt that what he heard was pure truth, and he was filled with unspeakable joy.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704693\" id=\"p_enGHy\">The next time he returned home, Oskar excitedly told Albertina all about the missionaries. He explained that he believed what they taught. He asked her to read the pamphlets they had given him, and he told her that he didn\u2019t think that any of their future children should be baptized as infants. Albertina was furious and threw the pamphlets on the rubbish heap. Not much was said between them before Oskar returned to work on Sunday evening.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704694\" id=\"p_kI3ji\">As soon as he was gone, Albertina retrieved those pamphlets. She carefully compared their doctrine with the teachings in her well-worn Bible. She was astonished to feel that what she read was true. The next time Oskar returned home, he received a warm welcome, as did the copy of the Book of Mormon he brought with him. Albertina eagerly read, again comparing the doctrine to that in her Bible. Like Oskar, she recognized pure truth and was filled with unspeakable joy.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704697\" id=\"p_kqOp3\">Oskar, Albertina, and their children moved to HÃ¶gmarsÃ¶ to be close to the few Church members there. A week after Oskar and Albertina were baptized in 1916, Oskar was called to be the group leader on HÃ¶gmarsÃ¶. Like many converts, Oskar and Albertina faced criticism because of their new faith. Local farmers refused to sell them milk, so Oskar rowed across the fjord every day to purchase milk from a more tolerant farmer.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704699\" id=\"p_dIzQM\">Yet during the ensuing years, Church membership on HÃ¶gmarsÃ¶ increased, in part because of Albertina\u2019s powerful testimony and burning missionary zeal. When the group became a branch, Oskar was called as the branch president.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704702\" id=\"p_e39sY\">Members of that HÃ¶gmarsÃ¶ branch revered that island. This was their Waters of Mormon.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note31\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"31\"><\/sup><\/a> This was where they came to a knowledge of their Redeemer.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704705\" id=\"p_ufgtZ\">Over the years, as they kept their baptismal covenant, Oskar and Albertina were transformed by the power of Jesus Christ. They longed to make more covenants and receive their temple blessings. To obtain those blessings, they permanently emigrated from their home in Sweden to Salt Lake City in 1949. Oskar had served as the leader of the members on HÃ¶gmarsÃ¶ for 33Â years.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note32\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"32\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704708\" id=\"p_iALhe\">The combination of nitroglycerin and kieselguhr made dynamite valuable; the combination of the gospel of Jesus Christ and His Church is beyond price. Oskar and Albertina heard about the restored gospel because a prophet of God had called, assigned, and sent missionaries to Sweden. By divine commission, missionaries taught the doctrine of Christ and by priesthood authority baptized Oskar and Albertina. As members, Oskar and Albertina continued learning, developing, and serving others. They became Latter-day Saints because they kept the covenants they made.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704711\" id=\"p_evLU8\">The Savior refers to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as \u201cmy church\u201d because He commissioned it to accomplish His purposes<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note33\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"33\"><\/sup><\/a>\u2014preaching His gospel, offering His ordinances and covenants, and making it possible for His power to justify and sanctify us.
