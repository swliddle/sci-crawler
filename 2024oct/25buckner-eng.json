They prayed \u201cseparately and vocally to the Lord to reveal his will unto [them].\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"3\"><\/sup><\/a> In acknowledgement of the prayers of these faithful members during times of intense trouble, the Lord comforted them,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"4\"><\/sup><\/a> addressing the Saints three times with two powerful words: \u201cmy friends.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"5\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704816\" id=\"p_k7IGx\">Jesus Christ has long called His faithful followers His friends. Fourteen times in the Doctrine and Covenants, the Savior uses the term <i>friend<\/i> to define a sacred and cherished relationship. I am not talking about the word <i>friend<\/i> as the world defines it\u2014subject to social media followers or \u201clikes.\u201d It cannot be captured in a hashtag or a number on Instagram or X.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704824\" id=\"p_jiPRu\">Admittedly, as a teenager, I remember dreaded conversations when I heard those painful words \u201cHey, can we just be friends?\u201d or \u201cLet\u2019s just stay in the friend zone.\u201d Nowhere in holy writ do we hear Him say, \u201cYe are just my friends.\u201d Rather, He taught that \u201cgreater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"6\"><\/sup><\/a> And \u201cye are they whom my Father hath given me; ye are my friends.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"7\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704832\" id=\"p_oo5Ae\">The sentiment is clear: the Savior numbers each of us and watches over us. This watchcare is not trivial or insignificant. Rather, it is exalting, elevating, and eternal. I see the Savior\u2019s declaration \u201cye are my friends\u201d as a clarion call to build higher and holier<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"8\"><\/sup><\/a> relationships among all of God\u2019s children \u201cthat we may be one.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"9\"><\/sup><\/a> We do this as we come together seeking both opportunities to unite and a sense of belonging for all.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"162704839\" id=\"p_bCtFp\">We Are One in Him<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"162704847\" id=\"p_vJFaJ\">The Savior beautifully demonstrated this in His call to \u201ccome, follow me.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"10\"><\/sup><\/a> He drew upon the gifts and individual attributes of a diverse group of followers to call His Apostles. He called fishermen,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"11\"><\/sup><\/a> zealots,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"12\"><\/sup><\/a> brothers known for their thunderous personalities,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"13\"><\/sup><\/a> and even a tax collector.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note14\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"14\"><\/sup><\/a> Their belief in the Savior and desire to draw unto Him united them. They looked to Him, saw God through Him, and \u201cstraightway left their nets, and followed Him.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note15\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"15\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704855\" id=\"p_ktApz\">I too have seen how building higher and holier relationships brings us together as one. My wife, Jennifer, and I were blessed to raise our five children in New York City. There in that busy metropolis, we formed precious and sacred relationships with neighbors, school friends, business associates, faith leaders, and fellow Saints.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704864\" id=\"p_jj5gk\">In May of 2020, just as the world was grappling with the spread of a global pandemic, members of the New York City Commission of Religious Leaders met virtually in an abruptly called meeting. There was no agenda. No special guests. Just a request to come together and discuss the challenges we were all facing as faith leaders. The Centers for Disease Control had just reported that our city was the epicenter of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. This meant no more gathering. No more coming together.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704874\" id=\"p_kl2eE\">For these religious leaders, removing the personal ministry, the congregational gathering, and the weekly worship was a devastating blow. Our small group\u2014which included a cardinal, reverend, rabbi, imam, pastor, monsignor, and an elder\u2014listened to, consoled, and supported one another. Instead of focusing on our differences, we saw what we had in common. We spoke of possibilities and then probabilities. We rallied and responded to questions about faith and the future. And then we prayed. Oh, how we prayed.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704884\" id=\"p_rr6Rz\">In a richly diverse city filled with complexity and colliding cultures, we saw our differences dissipate as we came together as friends with one voice, one purpose, and one prayer.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704894\" id=\"p_cyVhK\">No longer were we looking across the table at each other but heavenward with each other. We left each subsequent meeting more united and ready to pick up our \u201cshovels\u201d and go to work. The collaboration that resulted and the service rendered to thousands of New Yorkers taught me that in a world calling for division, distance, and disengagement, there is always much more that unites us than divides us. The Savior pled, \u201cBe one; and if ye are not one ye are not mine.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note16\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"16\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704905\" id=\"p_vy9Dr\">Brothers and sisters, we must stop looking for reasons to divide and instead seek opportunities to \u201cbe one.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note17\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"17\"><\/sup><\/a> He has blessed us with unique gifts and attributes that invite learning from one another and personal growth.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note18\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"18\"><\/sup><\/a> I often told my university students that if I do what you do and you do what I do, we don\u2019t need each other. But because you don\u2019t do what I do and I don\u2019t do what you do, we do need each other. And that need brings us together. To divide and conquer is the adversary\u2019s plan to destroy friendships, families, and faith. It is the Savior who unites.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"162704915\" id=\"p_sPF2T\">We Belong to Him<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"162704928\" id=\"p_cHN1Q\">One of the promised blessings of \u201cbecoming one\u201d is a powerful sense of belonging. Elder Quentin L. Cook taught that \u201cthe essence of truly belonging is to be one with Christ.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note19\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"19\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704937\" id=\"p_j4Fof\">On a recent visit with my family to the West African country of Ghana, I was enamored with a local custom. Upon arriving at a church or home, we were greeted with the words \u201cyou are welcome.\u201d When food was served, our host would announce, \u201cYou are invited.\u201d These simple greetings were extended with purpose and intentionality. <em>You are welcome. You are invited.<\/em><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704946\" id=\"p_rt5we\">We place similar sacred declarations on our meetinghouse doors. But the sign Visitors Welcome is not enough. Do we warmly welcome all who come through the doors? Brothers and sisters, it is not enough to just sit in the pews. We must heed the Savior\u2019s call to build higher and holier relationships with all of God\u2019s children. We must live our faith! My father often reminded me that simply sitting in a pew on Sunday doesn\u2019t make you a good Christian any more than sleeping in a garage makes you a car.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704955\" id=\"p_l3GV6\">We must live our life so that the world does not see us but sees Him through us. This does not take place only on Sundays. It takes place at the grocery store, the gas pump, the school meeting, the neighborhood gathering\u2014all places where baptized and unbaptized members of our family work and live.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704964\" id=\"p_yPYDr\">I worship on Sunday as a reminder that we need each other and together we need Him. Our unique gifts and talents that differentiate us in a secular world unite us in a sacred space.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note20\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"20\"><\/sup><\/a> The Savior has called upon us to help one another, lift one another, and edify each other.
