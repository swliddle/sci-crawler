Hales<\/p>\n<p class=\"author-role\" data-aid=\"162704869\" id=\"p_gQ6H3\">Of the Seventy<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"kicker\" data-aid=\"162704879\" id=\"p_rJ2AK\">Despite the challenges we all face, our loving Heavenly Father has designed the plan of happiness such that we are not destined to fail.<\/p>\n<\/header>\n<div class=\"body-block\">\n<p data-aid=\"162704889\" id=\"p_uAa8K\">For several years I was assigned to home teach an older sister in my ward. She did not have an easy life. She had various health problems and experienced a lifetime of pain due to a childhood accident on the playground. Divorced at age 32 with four young children to raise and provide for, she remarried at age 50. Her second husband passed away when she was 66, and this sister lived an additional 26 years as a widow.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704899\" id=\"p_xhKZn\">Despite her lifelong challenges, she was faithful to her covenants to the end. This sister was an avid genealogist, a temple attender, and a collector and writer of family histories. Though she had many difficult trials, and without question she felt at times sadness and loneliness, she had a cheerful countenance and a gracious and pleasant personality.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704913\" id=\"p_h6ev7\">Nine months after her passing, one of her sons had a remarkable experience in the temple. He learned by the power of the Holy Ghost that his mother had a message for him. She communicated with him, but not by vision or audible words. The following unmistakable message came into the son\u2019s mind from his mother: \u201cI want you to know that mortality works, and I want you to know that I now understand why everything happened [in my life] the way it did\u2014and it is all OK.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"1\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704932\" id=\"p_ykuPD\">This message is all the more remarkable when one considers her situation and the difficulties this sister endured and overcame.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704941\" id=\"p_m1JyK\">Brothers and sisters, mortality works! It is designed to work! Despite the challenges, heartaches, and difficulties we all face, our loving, wise, and perfect Heavenly Father has designed the plan of happiness such that we are not destined to fail. His plan provides a way for us to rise above our mortal failures. The Lord has said, \u201cThis is my work and my glory\u2014to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"2\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704950\" id=\"p_apDUE\">Nonetheless, if we are to be the beneficiaries of the Lord\u2019s \u201cwork and \u2026 glory,\u201d even \u201cimmortality and eternal life,\u201d we must expect to be schooled and taught and to pass through the refiner\u2019s fire\u2014sometimes to our utter limits. To completely avoid the problems, challenges, and difficulties of this world would be to sidestep the process that is truly necessary for mortality to work.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704959\" id=\"p_cT73b\">And so we should not be surprised when hard times come upon us. We will encounter situations that try us and people who enable us to practice true charity and patience. But we need to bear up under our difficulties and remember, as the Lord said:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704968\" id=\"p_ly9YH\">\u201cAnd whoso layeth down his life in my cause, for my name\u2019s sake, shall find it again, even life eternal.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704977\" id=\"p_beBWM\">\u201cTherefore, be not afraid of your enemies [or your problems, challenges, or the tests of this life], for I have decreed \u2026 , saith the Lord, that I will prove you in all things, whether you will abide in my covenant \u2026 that you may be found worthy.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"3\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704985\" id=\"p_qc2vL\">When we feel distraught or anxious about our problems or feel that we might be receiving more than our fair share of life\u2019s difficulties, we can remember what the Lord said to the children of Israel:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704994\" id=\"p_fOGVh\">\u201cAnd thou shalt remember all the way[s] which the Lord thy God led thee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, and to prove thee, to know what [is] in thine heart, whether thou [would] keep his commandments, or no.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"4\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705002\" id=\"p_tgKhp\">As Lehi taught his son Jacob:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705011\" id=\"p_lHVl7\">\u201cThou hast suffered afflictions and much sorrow. \u2026 Nevertheless, \u2026 [God] shall consecrate thine afflictions for thy gain. \u2026 Wherefore, I know that thou art redeemed, because of the righteousness of thy Redeemer.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"5\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705025\" id=\"p_nBf1y\">Because this life is a testing ground and \u201cdark clouds of trouble hang o\u2019er us and threaten our peace to destroy,\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"6\"><\/sup><\/a> it is helpful to remember this counsel and promise found in <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/23?lang=eng\">Mosiah 23<\/a> relating to life\u2019s challenges: \u201cNevertheless\u2014whosoever putteth his trust in [the Lord] the same shall be lifted up at the last day.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"7\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705032\" id=\"p_g0uMZ\">As a youth, I personally experienced great emotional pain and shame that came as the result of the unrighteous actions of another, which for many years affected my self-worth and my sense of worthiness before the Lord. Nevertheless, I bear personal witness that the Lord can strengthen us and bear us up in whatever difficulties we are called upon to experience during our sojourn in this vale of tears.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705040\" id=\"p_y6Ad9\">We are familiar with Paul\u2019s experience:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705048\" id=\"p_by0LT\">\u201cAnd lest I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of the revelations [I have received], there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, the messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705055\" id=\"p_bemlk\">\u201cFor this thing I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705060\" id=\"p_erNvO\">\u201cAnd he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly therefore will I rather glory in my infirmities, that the power of Christ may rest upon me.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"8\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705065\" id=\"p_wzSHS\">We don\u2019t know what Paul\u2019s \u201cthorn in the flesh\u201d was. He chose not to describe whether it was a physical ailment, a mental or emotional infirmity, or a temptation. But we don\u2019t need to know that detail to know that he struggled and pleaded with the Lord for help and that, ultimately, the Lord\u2019s strength and power are what helped him through it.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705070\" id=\"p_sh6zS\">Like it was for Paul, it was through the Lord\u2019s help that I was eventually strengthened emotionally and spiritually and finally recognized after many years that I have always been a person of worth and worthy of the blessings of the gospel. The Savior helped me to overcome my feelings of unworthiness and to extend sincere forgiveness to the offender.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"9\"><\/sup><\/a> I finally understood that the Savior\u2019s Atonement was a personal gift for me and that my Heavenly Father and His Son love me perfectly. Because of the Savior\u2019s Atonement, mortality works.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705075\" id=\"p_q8AyR\">While I was eventually blessed to recognize how the Savior rescued me and stood by me through those experiences, I clearly understand that the unfortunate situation of my teenage years was <em>my<\/em> personal journey and experience, the resolution of which and eventual outcome cannot be projected onto those who have suffered and continue to suffer from the unrighteous behavior of others.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705080\" id=\"p_s1eoW\">I recognize that life\u2019s experiences\u2014good and bad\u2014can teach us important lessons. I now know and bear testimony that mortality works! I hope that as a result of the sum of my life\u2019s experiences\u2014good and bad\u2014I have compassion for innocent victims of another\u2019s actions and empathy for the downtrodden.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705085\" id=\"p_mpb4p\">I sincerely hope that as a result of my life\u2019s experiences\u2014good and bad\u2014I am kinder to others, treat others as the Savior would, and have greater understanding for the sinner and that I have complete integrity. As we come to rely on the Savior\u2019s grace and keep our covenants, we can serve as examples of the far-reaching effects of the Savior\u2019s Atonement.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705092\" id=\"p_h9Qd7\">I share a final example that mortality works.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"image no-print\" id=\"fig_wldsa\">\n<img alt=\"Elder Hales\u2019s aunt and mother.\" id=\"img_iMXdO\" src=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/ylvbypumck6qxf257hqt0re44jbz7br55cxxvatx/full/500%2C/0/default\" data-img-id=\"ylvbypumck6qxf257hqt0re44jbz7br55cxxvatx\" srcset=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/ylvbypumck6qxf257hqt0re44jbz7br55cxxvatx/full/60%2C/0/default 60w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/ylvbypumck6qxf257hqt0re44jbz7br55cxxvatx/full/100%2C/0/default 100w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/ylvbypumck6qxf257hqt0re44jbz7br55cxxvatx/full/200%2C/0/default 200w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/ylvbypumck6qxf257hqt0re44jbz7br55cxxvatx/full/250%2C/0/default 250w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/ylvbypumck6qxf257hqt0re44jbz7br55cxxvatx/full/320%2C/0/default 320w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/ylvbypumck6qxf257hqt0re44jbz7br55cxxvatx/full/500%2C/0/default 500w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/ylvbypumck6qxf257hqt0re44jbz7br55cxxvatx/full/640%2C/0/default 640w\" data-assetId=\"ylvbypumck6qxf257hqt0re44jbz7br55cxxvatx\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"720\" data-aspect-ratio=\"0.6944444444444444\"/>\n<figcaption>\n<p data-aid=\"162705098\" id=\"p_a0J5r\">Elder Hales\u2019s aunt, Lois VandenBosch, and his mother, Klea VandenBosch.<\/p>\n<\/figcaption>\n<\/figure>\n<p data-aid=\"162705105\" id=\"p_wP0gJ\">My mother did not have an easy journey through mortality. She received no accolades or worldly honors and did not have educational opportunities beyond high school. She contracted polio as a child, resulting in a lifetime of pain and discomfort in her left leg. As an adult, she experienced many difficult and challenging physical and financial circumstances but was faithful to her covenants and loved the Lord.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705112\" id=\"p_sz0kv\">When my mother was 55, my next older sister passed away, leaving an eight-month-old baby daughter, my niece, motherless. For various reasons, Mom ended up largely raising my niece for the next 17 years, often under very trying circumstances. Yet, notwithstanding these experiences, she happily and willingly served her family, neighbors, and ward members and served as an ordinance worker in the temple for many years. During the last several years of her life, Mom suffered from a form of dementia, was often confused, and was confined to a nursing facility. Regrettably, she was alone when she passed away unexpectedly.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705119\" id=\"p_jpLIC\">Several months after her passing, I had a dream I have never forgotten. In my dream, I was sitting in my office at the Church Administration Building. Mom entered the office. I knew she had come from the spirit world. I will always remember the feelings I had. She did not say anything, but she radiated a spiritual beauty that I had never before experienced and which I have difficulty describing.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705126\" id=\"p_ws4SK\">Her countenance and being were truly stunning! I remember saying to her, \u201cMother, you are so beautiful!,\u201d referencing her spiritual power and beauty. She acknowledged me\u2014again without speaking. I felt her love for me, and I knew then that she is happy and healed from her worldly cares and challenges and eagerly awaits \u201ca glorious resurrection.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"10\"><\/sup><\/a> I know that for Mom, mortality worked\u2014and that it works for us too.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705133\" id=\"p_bi8vc\">God\u2019s work and glory is to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"11\"><\/sup><\/a> The experiences of mortality are part of the journey that allows us to grow and progress toward that immortality and eternal life. We were not sent here to fail but to succeed in God\u2019s plan for us.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705139\" id=\"p_ynbBE\">As King Benjamin taught: \u201cAnd moreover, I would desire that ye should consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments of God. For behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual; and if they hold out faithful to the end they are received into heaven, that thereby they may dwell with God in a state of never-ending happiness.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"12\"><\/sup><\/a> In other words, mortality works!<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705152\" id=\"p_aPND7\">I testify that as we receive the ordinances of the gospel, enter into covenants with God and then keep those covenants, repent, serve others, and endure to the end, we too can have the assurance and complete trust in the Lord that mortality works! I testify of Jesus Christ and that our glorious future with our Heavenly Father is made possible by the grace and Atonement of the Savior. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<footer class=\"notes\">\n<p class=\"title\" data-aid=\"162705159\" id=\"p_ei4tr\">Notes<\/p>\n<ol class=\"decimal\" data-type=\"marker\" start=\"1\">\n<li data-marker=\"1.\" id=\"note1\" data-full-marker=\"1.\">\n<p data-aid=\"162705166\" id=\"p_gL5AP\">Shared with permission.
