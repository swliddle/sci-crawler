Unsuccessful efforts had been made over many generations to bring the Lamanite people to a belief in the doctrine of Christ.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"1\"><\/sup><\/a> This time, however, through the miraculous interventions of the Holy Spirit, thousands of the Lamanites were converted and became disciples of Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162703362\" id=\"p_xgt0O\">We read, \u201cAnd as sure as the Lord liveth, so sure as many as believed, or as many as were brought to the knowledge of the truth, through the preaching of Ammon and his brethren, according to the spirit of revelation and of prophecy, and the power of God working miracles in them\u2014yea, I say unto you, as the Lord liveth, as many of the Lamanites as believed in their preaching, and were converted unto the Lord, never did fall away.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"2\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162703367\" id=\"p_vtS3d\">The key to the enduring conversion of this people is stated in the next verse: \u201cFor they became a righteous people; they did lay down the weapons of their rebellion, that they did not fight against God any more, neither against any of their brethren.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"3\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162703375\" id=\"p_ies0y\">This reference to \u201cweapons of rebellion\u201d was both literal and figurative. It meant their swords and other weapons of war but also their disobedience to God and His commandments.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705381\" id=\"p_kVcnQ\">The king of these converted Lamanites expressed it this way: \u201cAnd now behold, my brethren, \u2026 it has been all that we could do \u2026 to repent of all our sins and the many murders which we have committed, and to get God <em>to take them away from our hearts<\/em>, for it was all we could do to repent sufficiently before God that he would <em>take away our stain<\/em>.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"4\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705388\" id=\"p_wDE03\">Note the king\u2019s words\u2014not only had their sincere repentance led to forgiveness of their sins, but God also took away the stain of those sins and even the desire to sin from their hearts. As you know, rather than risk any possible return to their prior state of rebellion against God, they buried their swords. And as they buried their physical weapons, with changed hearts, they also buried their disposition to sin.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705392\" id=\"p_urQow\">We might ask ourselves what we could do to follow this pattern, to \u201clay down the weapons of [our] rebellion,\u201d whatever they may be, and become so \u201cconverted [to] the Lord\u201d that the stain of sin and the desire for sin are taken from our hearts and we never will fall away.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705400\" id=\"p_dMGMh\">Rebellion can be active or passive. The classic example of willful rebellion is Lucifer, who, in the premortal world, opposed the Father\u2019s plan of redemption and rallied others to oppose it as well, \u201cand, at that day, many followed after him.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"5\"><\/sup><\/a> It is not hard to discern the impact of his continuing rebellion in our own time.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705402\" id=\"p_swXw3\">The Book of Mormon\u2019s unholy trio of anti-Christs\u2014Sherem, Nehor, and Korihor\u2014provide a classic study of active rebellion against God. The overarching thesis of Nehor and Korihor was that there is no sin; therefore, there is no need for repentance, and there is no Savior. \u201cEvery man prosper[s] according to his genius, and \u2026 every man conquer[s] according to his strength; and whatsoever a man [does is] no crime.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"6\"><\/sup><\/a> The anti-Christ rejects religious authority, characterizing ordinances and covenants as performances \u201claid down by ancient priests, to usurp power and authority.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"7\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<img alt=\"William W.

Phelps. Phelps joined the Church in 1831 and was appointed Church printer. He edited several early Church publications, wrote numerous hymns, and served as a scribe to Joseph Smith. Unfortunately, he turned against the Church and the Prophet, even to the point of giving false testimony against Joseph Smith in a Missouri court, which contributed to the Prophet\u2019s imprisonment there.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705417\" id=\"p_mBLMG\">Later, Phelps wrote to Joseph asking for forgiveness. \u201cI know my situation, you know it, and God knows it, and I want to be saved if my friends will help me.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705424\" id=\"p_rRmQf\">In his reply the Prophet stated: \u201cIt is true that we have suffered much in consequence of your behavior. \u2026 However, the cup has been drunk, the will of our Heavenly Father has been done, and we are yet alive. \u2026 Come on, dear brother, since the war is past, for friends at first are friends again at last.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"8\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705430\" id=\"p_pw8GY\">With sincere repentance, William Phelps buried his \u201cweapons of rebellion\u201d and was received once more in full fellowship, never again to fall away.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705434\" id=\"p_b4vzn\">Perhaps the more insidious form of rebellion against God, however, is the passive version\u2014ignoring His will in our lives. Many who would never consider active rebellion may still oppose the will and word of God by pursuing their own path without regard to divine direction. I am reminded of the song made famous years ago by singer Frank Sinatra with the climactic line \u201cI did it my way.\u201d Certainly in life there is plenty of room for personal preference and individual choice, but when it comes to matters of salvation and eternal life, our theme song ought to be \u201cI did it God\u2019s way,\u201d because truly there is no other way.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705444\" id=\"p_hSSr1\">Take, for instance, the Savior\u2019s example regarding baptism. He submitted to baptism as a demonstration of loyalty to the Father and as an example to us:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705450\" id=\"p_vPxeB\">\u201cHe showeth unto the children of men that, according to the flesh he humbleth himself before the Father, and witnesseth unto the Father that he would be obedient unto him in keeping his commandments. \u2026<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705456\" id=\"p_xj9Dd\">\u201cAnd he said unto the children of men: Follow thou me. Wherefore, my beloved brethren, can we follow Jesus save we shall be willing to keep the commandments of the Father?\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"9\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705462\" id=\"p_mJ7AS\">There is no \u201cmy way\u201d if we are to follow Christ\u2019s example. Trying to find a different course to heaven is like the futility of working on the Tower of Babel rather than looking to Christ and His salvation.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705468\" id=\"p_uxgT6\">The swords and other weapons that the Lamanite converts buried were weapons of rebellion because of how they had used them. Those same kinds of weapons in the hands of their sons, being used in defense of family and freedom, were not weapons of rebellion against God at all.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"10\"><\/sup><\/a> The same was true of such weapons in the hands of the Nephites: \u201cThey were not fighting for monarchy nor power but \u2026 were fighting for their homes and their liberties, their wives and their children, and their all, yea, for their rites of worship and their church.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"11\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705473\" id=\"p_wPJCu\">In this same way, there are things in our lives that may be neutral or even inherently good but that used in the wrong way become \u201cweapons of rebellion.\u201d Our speech, for example, can edify or demean. As James said:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705479\" id=\"p_tLi2U\">\u201cBut the tongue [it seems] can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poison.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705482\" id=\"p_jirST\">\u201cTherewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse we men, which are made after the similitude of God.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705489\" id=\"p_kgGHC\">\u201cOut of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My brethren, these things ought not so to be.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"12\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705494\" id=\"p_xMaX1\">There is much in public and personal discourse today that is malicious and mean-spirited. There is much conversation that is vulgar and profane, even among youth. This sort of speech is a \u201cweapon of rebellion\u201d against God, \u201cfull of deadly poison.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"13\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705501\" id=\"p_oZ83D\">Consider another example of something that is essentially good but that could be turned against divine directives\u2014a person\u2019s career. One can find real satisfaction in a profession, vocation, or service, and all of us are benefited by what devoted and talented people in many fields of endeavor have accomplished and created.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705508\" id=\"p_cpWy6\">Still, it is possible that devotion to career can become the paramount focus of one\u2019s life. Then all else becomes secondary, including any claim the Savior may make on one\u2019s time and talent. For men, and for women as well, forgoing legitimate opportunities for marriage, failing to cleave to and lift one\u2019s spouse, failing to nurture one\u2019s children, or even intentionally avoiding the blessing and responsibility of child-rearing solely for the sake of career advancement can convert laudable achievement into a form of rebellion.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705514\" id=\"p_zvl6q\">Another example concerns our physical being. Paul reminds us that we are to glorify God in both body and spirit<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note14\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"14\"><\/sup><\/a> and that this body is the temple of the Holy Ghost, \u201cwhich ye have of God, and ye are not your own.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note15\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"15\"><\/sup><\/a> Thus, we have a legitimate interest in spending time caring for our bodies as best we can. Few of us will reach the peak of performance we have seen recently in the achievements of Olympic and Paralympic athletes, and some of us are experiencing the effects of age, or what President M. Russell Ballard called \u201cthe rivets coming loose.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705521\" id=\"p_zR9fX\">Nevertheless, I believe it pleases our Creator when we do our best to care for His wonderful gift of a physical body. It would be a mark of rebellion to deface or defile one\u2019s body, or abuse it, or fail to do what one can to pursue a healthy lifestyle. At the same time, vanity and becoming consumed with one\u2019s physique, appearance, or dress can be a form of rebellion at the other extreme, leading one to worship God\u2019s gift instead of God.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705527\" id=\"p_f62xO\">In the end, burying our weapons of rebellion against God simply means yielding to the enticing of the Holy Spirit, putting off the natural man, and becoming \u201ca saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note16\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"16\"><\/sup><\/a> It means putting the first commandment first in our lives. It means letting God prevail. If our love of God and our determination to serve Him with all our might, mind, and strength become the touchstone by which we judge all things and make all our decisions, we will have buried our weapons of rebellion. By the grace of Christ, God will forgive our sins and rebellions of the past and will take away the stain of those sins and rebellions from our hearts. In time, He will even take away any desire for evil, as He did with those Lamanite converts of the past. Thereafter, we too \u201cnever [will] fall away.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note17\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"17\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705532\" id=\"p_znndb\">Burying our weapons of rebellion leads to a unique joy. With all who have ever become converted to the Lord, we are \u201cbrought to sing [the song of] redeeming love.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note18\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"18\"><\/sup><\/a> Our Heavenly Father and His Son, our Redeemer, have confirmed Their unending commitment to our ultimate happiness through the most profound love and sacrifice. We experience Their love daily. Surely we can reciprocate with our own love and loyalty. May we bury\u2014very, very deep\u2014any element of rebellion against God in our lives and replace it with a willing heart and a willing mind.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note19\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"19\"><\/sup><\/a> In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<footer class=\"notes\">\n<p class=\"title\" data-aid=\"162705539\" id=\"p_gMGZ2\">Notes<\/p>\n<ol class=\"decimal\" data-type=\"marker\" start=\"1\">\n<li data-marker=\"1.\" id=\"note1\" data-full-marker=\"1.\">\n<p data-aid=\"162705543\" id=\"p_jh4yu\">See, for example, <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/bofm/jacob/7?lang=eng&amp;id=p24#p24\">Jacob 7:24<\/a>; <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/bofm/enos/1?lang=eng&amp;id=p14%2C20#p14\">Enos 1:14, 20<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"2.\" id=\"note2\" data-full-marker=\"2.\">\n<p data-aid=\"162705551\" id=\"p_xbwPa\"><a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/23?lang=eng&amp;id=p6#p6\">Alma 23:6<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"3.\" id=\"note3\" data-full-marker=\"3.\">\n<p data-aid=\"162705555\" id=\"p_mtGL8\"><a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/23?lang=eng&amp;id=p7#p7\">Alma 23:7<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"4.\" id=\"note4\" data-full-marker=\"4.\">\n<p data-aid=\"162705561\" id=\"p_gyDza\"><a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/24?lang=eng&amp;id=p11#p11\">Alma 24:11<\/a>; emphasis added.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"5.\" id=\"note5\" data-full-marker=\"5.\">\n<p data-aid=\"162705564\" id=\"p_agAcE\"><a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/pgp/abr/3?lang=eng&amp;id=p28#p28\">Abraham 3:28<\/a>; see also <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/nt/rev/12?lang=eng&amp;id=p7-p9#p7\">Revelation 12:7\u20139<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"6.\" id=\"note6\" data-full-marker=\"6.\">\n<p data-aid=\"162705572\" id=\"p_uS8se\"><a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/30?lang=eng&amp;id=p17#p17\">Alma 30:17<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"7.\" id=\"note7\" data-full-marker=\"7.\">\n<p data-aid=\"162705575\" id=\"p_s9Xbc\"><a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/30?lang=eng&amp;id=p23#p23\">Alma 30:23<\/a>; see also verses <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/30?lang=eng&amp;id=p27-p28#p27\">27\u201328<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"8.\" id=\"note8\" data-full-marker=\"8.\">\n<p data-aid=\"162705579\" id=\"p_tQwfA\"><cite><a class=\"cross-ref\" href=\"/study/history/saints-v1/35-a-beautiful-place?lang=eng&amp;id=p13-p15#p13\">Saints: The Story of the Church of Jesus Christ in the Latter Days<\/a><\/cite>, vol. 1, <cite>The Standard of Truth, 1815\u20131846<\/cite> (2018), 418; see also \u201c<a href=\"https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paper-summary/letter-from-william-w-phelps-with-appended-letter-from-orson-hyde-and-john-e-page-29-june-1840/1\">Letter from William W.
