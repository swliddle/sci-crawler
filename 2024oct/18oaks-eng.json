Our experiences in mortality are like the little boy and his father flying a kite on a windy day. As the kite rose higher, the winds caused it to tug on the connecting string in the little boy\u2019s hand. Inexperienced with the force of mortal winds, he proposed to cut the string so the kite could rise higher. His wise father counseled no, explaining that the string is what holds the kite in place against mortal winds. If we lose our hold on the string, the kite will not rise higher. It will be carried about by these winds and inevitably crash to the earth.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705406\" id=\"p_lLjEa\">That essential string represents the covenants that connect us to God, our Heavenly Father, and His Son, Jesus Christ. As we honor those covenants by keeping Their commandments and following Their plan of redemption, Their promised blessings enable us to soar to celestial heights.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705411\" id=\"p_ipgNK\">The Book of Mormon frequently declares that Christ is \u201cthe light of the world.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"4\"><\/sup><\/a> During His appearance to the Nephites, the risen Lord explained that teaching by telling them: \u201cI have set an example for you.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"5\"><\/sup><\/a> \u201cI am the light which ye shall hold up\u2014that which ye have seen me do.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"6\"><\/sup><\/a> He is our role model. We learn what He has said and done by studying the scriptures and following prophetic teachings, as President Russell M. Nelson has urged us to do.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"7\"><\/sup><\/a> In the ordinance of the sacrament, we covenant each Sabbath day that we will \u201calways remember him and keep his commandments.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"8\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"sec_m5KAp\">\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"162705416\" id=\"p_eR43c\">II.<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"162705421\" id=\"p_byEkx\">In the Book of Mormon, the Lord gave us the fundamentals in what He called \u201cthe doctrine of Christ.\u201d These are faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, enduring to the end, and becoming as a little child,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"9\"><\/sup><\/a> which means to trust the Lord and submit to all He requires of us.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"10\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705427\" id=\"p_xfPgG\">The Lord\u2019s commandments are of two types: permanent, like the doctrine of Christ, and temporary. Temporary commandments are those necessary for the needs of the Lord\u2019s Church or the faithful in temporary circumstances, but to be set aside when the need has passed. An example of temporary commandments are the Lord\u2019s directions to the early leadership of the Church to move the Saints from New York to Ohio, to Missouri, and to Illinois and finally to lead the pioneer exodus to the Intermountain West. Though only temporary, when still in force these commandments were given to be obeyed.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705432\" id=\"p_w86Lf\">Some permanent commandments have taken considerable time to be generally observed. For example, President Lorenzo Snow\u2019s famous sermon on the law of tithing emphasized a commandment given earlier but not yet generally observed by Church members.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"11\"><\/sup><\/a> It needed reemphasis in the circumstances then faced by the Church and its members. Recent examples of reemphases have also been needed because of current circumstances faced by Latter-day Saints or the Church. These include the proclamation on the family, issued by President Gordon B. Hinckley a generation ago,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"12\"><\/sup><\/a> and President Russell M. Nelson\u2019s recent call for the Church to be known by its revealed name, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"13\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"sec_k8p7r\">\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"162705436\" id=\"p_pMo5b\">III.<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"162705441\" id=\"p_kNe0k\">Another of our Savior\u2019s teachings seems to require reemphasis in the circumstances of our day.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705449\" id=\"p_ezU20\">This is a time of many harsh and hurtful words in public communications and sometimes even in our families. Sharp differences on issues of public policy often result in actions of hostility\u2014even hatred\u2014in public and personal relationships. This atmosphere of enmity sometimes even paralyzes capacities for lawmaking on matters of importance where most citizens see an urgent need for some action in the public interest.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705452\" id=\"p_z4qxi\">What should followers of Christ teach and do in this time of toxic communications?

While He taught this in the context of disputes over religious doctrine, the reasons He gave clearly apply to communications and relationships in politics, public policy, and family relationships. Jesus taught:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705465\" id=\"p_w2Lbk\">\u201cHe that hath the spirit of contention is not of me, but is of the devil, who is the father of contention, and he stirreth up the hearts of men to contend with anger, one with another.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705469\" id=\"p_nEtgy\">\u201cBehold, this is not my doctrine, to stir up the hearts of men with anger, one against another; but this is my doctrine, that such things should be done away.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note14\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"14\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705477\" id=\"p_yeWQB\">In His remaining ministry among the Nephites, Jesus taught other commandments closely related to His prohibition of contention. We know from the Bible that He had previously taught each of these in His great Sermon on the Mount, usually in precisely the same language He later used with the Nephites. I will quote the familiar Bible language:<\/p>\n<img alt=\"The Savior teaching in Jerusalem.\" id=\"img_gMi9n\" src=\"https://churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/937c2934231011edb2d9eeeeac1ea7e66e30d46e/full/500%2C/0/default\" data-img-id=\"937c2934231011edb2d9eeeeac1ea7e66e30d46e\" srcset=\"https://churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/937c2934231011edb2d9eeeeac1ea7e66e30d46e/full/60%2C/0/default 60w,https://churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/937c2934231011edb2d9eeeeac1ea7e66e30d46e/full/100%2C/0/default 100w,https://churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/937c2934231011edb2d9eeeeac1ea7e66e30d46e/full/200%2C/0/default 200w,https://churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/937c2934231011edb2d9eeeeac1ea7e66e30d46e/full/250%2C/0/default 250w,https://churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/937c2934231011edb2d9eeeeac1ea7e66e30d46e/full/320%2C/0/default 320w,https://churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/937c2934231011edb2d9eeeeac1ea7e66e30d46e/full/500%2C/0/default 500w,https://churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/937c2934231011edb2d9eeeeac1ea7e66e30d46e/full/640%2C/0/default 640w\" data-assetId=\"937c2934231011edb2d9eeeeac1ea7e66e30d46e\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"333\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.5015015015015014\"/>\n<p data-aid=\"162705485\" id=\"p_nu7Ue\">\u201cLove your enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefully use you, and persecute you.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note15\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"15\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705488\" id=\"p_dLQzt\">This is one of Christ\u2019s best-known commandments\u2014most revolutionary and most difficult to follow.
