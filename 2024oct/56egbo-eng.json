As the final ended, jubilant crowds poured onto the streets of every city and town in Nigeria; this country of 200 million people was instantly transformed into a massive celebration at two o\u2019clock in the morning! There was infectious joy, happiness, and excitement as people ate, sang, and danced. In that moment, Nigeria was united and every Nigerian was content being Nigerian.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162706338\" id=\"p_iq5XG\">Before the Olympics, this team faced numerous challenges. As the tournament began, their financial support ended. The team competed without proper kits, training venues, food, or laundry services.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"image no-print\" id=\"fig_s0csL\">\n<img alt=\"Nigerian football team with gold medals.\" id=\"img_gFBcR\" src=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/1k3x40lf3aimgtfwa8v8mswn2yoft1z8xev1btkl/full/500%2C/0/default\" data-img-id=\"1k3x40lf3aimgtfwa8v8mswn2yoft1z8xev1btkl\" srcset=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/1k3x40lf3aimgtfwa8v8mswn2yoft1z8xev1btkl/full/60%2C/0/default 60w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/1k3x40lf3aimgtfwa8v8mswn2yoft1z8xev1btkl/full/100%2C/0/default 100w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/1k3x40lf3aimgtfwa8v8mswn2yoft1z8xev1btkl/full/200%2C/0/default 200w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/1k3x40lf3aimgtfwa8v8mswn2yoft1z8xev1btkl/full/250%2C/0/default 250w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/1k3x40lf3aimgtfwa8v8mswn2yoft1z8xev1btkl/full/320%2C/0/default 320w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/1k3x40lf3aimgtfwa8v8mswn2yoft1z8xev1btkl/full/500%2C/0/default 500w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/1k3x40lf3aimgtfwa8v8mswn2yoft1z8xev1btkl/full/640%2C/0/default 640w\" data-assetId=\"1k3x40lf3aimgtfwa8v8mswn2yoft1z8xev1btkl\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"333\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.5015015015015014\"/>\n<div class=\"credit\">\n<p data-aid=\"162706345\" id=\"p_swivM\">Jerome Prevost/Getty Images<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<p data-aid=\"162706354\" id=\"p_m0W3E\">At one point, they were minutes away from being eliminated from competition, but the Nigerian team triumphed against all odds. This pivotal moment changed how they saw themselves. With newfound confidence, and with individual and team hard work and dogged determination, they unitedly ignored distractions and focused on winning. This focus earned them gold medals, and Nigerians christened them the \u201cDream Team.\u201d The Dream Team at the 1996 Olympics continues to be referenced in Nigerian sports.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"image no-print\" id=\"fig_tD8y4\">\n<img alt=\"Nigeria\u2019s Dream Team.\" id=\"img_fczO7\" src=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/08orhojshswkhzvr5x3aljzr4ajjus0de6dti90o/full/500%2C/0/default\" data-img-id=\"08orhojshswkhzvr5x3aljzr4ajjus0de6dti90o\" srcset=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/08orhojshswkhzvr5x3aljzr4ajjus0de6dti90o/full/60%2C/0/default 60w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/08orhojshswkhzvr5x3aljzr4ajjus0de6dti90o/full/100%2C/0/default 100w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/08orhojshswkhzvr5x3aljzr4ajjus0de6dti90o/full/200%2C/0/default 200w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/08orhojshswkhzvr5x3aljzr4ajjus0de6dti90o/full/250%2C/0/default 250w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/08orhojshswkhzvr5x3aljzr4ajjus0de6dti90o/full/320%2C/0/default 320w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/08orhojshswkhzvr5x3aljzr4ajjus0de6dti90o/full/500%2C/0/default 500w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/08orhojshswkhzvr5x3aljzr4ajjus0de6dti90o/full/640%2C/0/default 640w\" data-assetId=\"08orhojshswkhzvr5x3aljzr4ajjus0de6dti90o\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"727\" data-aspect-ratio=\"0.687757909215956\"/>\n<div class=\"credit\">\n<p data-aid=\"162706362\" id=\"p_tHTyf\">David Cannon/Allsport/Getty Images<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<p data-aid=\"162706371\" id=\"p_xfvGa\">Once the football team learned to ignore the many distractions facing them and focused on their goal, they succeeded beyond what they thought possible and experienced great joy. (As did the rest of us in Nigeria!)<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162706380\" id=\"p_pWawU\">In a similar way, when we ignore the distractions of the world and focus on Christ and His gospel, we are guaranteed success beyond what we can fully imagine and can feel great joy. President Russell M. Nelson taught: \u201cWhen the focus of our lives is on \u2026 Jesus Christ and His gospel, we can feel joy regardless of what is happening\u2014or not happening\u2014in our lives.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"1\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162706388\" id=\"p_lmMyU\">I pray that the Holy Ghost will help each of us to heed President Nelson\u2019s invitation to focus our lives on \u201cJesus Christ and His gospel\u201d so we can experience joy in Christ \u201cregardless of what is happening\u2014or not happening\u2014in our lives.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"2\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162706397\" id=\"p_nLNBO\">Several accounts in the Book of Mormon describe individuals who turned their lives around by focusing on Jesus Christ and His gospel.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162706405\" id=\"p_n27EL\">Consider Alma the Younger. He rebelled and fought against the Church. His father, Alma, prayed and fasted. An angel appeared and called Alma the Younger to repentance. In that moment, Alma began to suffer \u201cthe pains of a damned soul.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"3\"><\/sup><\/a> In his darkest hours, he remembered his father teaching that Christ would come to atone for the sins of the world. As his mind caught hold on this thought, he pled with God for mercy. Joy was the result, a joy he described as exquisite!<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"4\"><\/sup><\/a> Mercy and joy came to Alma because he and his father focused on the Savior.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162706412\" id=\"p_pC6TV\">For parents with children who have strayed, take heart! Instead of wondering why an angel does not come to help your child repent, know that the Lord has placed a mortal angel in his or her path: the bishop, another Church leader, or a ministering brother or sister. If you keep fasting and praying, if you do not set a timetable or a deadline for God, and if you trust that He is stretching forth His hand to help, then\u2014sooner or later\u2014you find God touching the heart of your child when your child chooses to listen. This is so because Christ is joy\u2014Christ is hope;<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"5\"><\/sup><\/a> He is the promise \u201cof good things to come.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"6\"><\/sup><\/a> So trust Jesus Christ with your child, for He is the strength of every parent<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"7\"><\/sup><\/a> and every child.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162706420\" id=\"p_z7SJp\">Once he experienced joy in Christ, Alma the Younger lived with that joy. But how did he maintain such joy even through difficulty and trial? He states:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162706428\" id=\"p_qQjiC\">\u201cFrom that time even until now, I have labored without ceasing, [to] bring souls unto repentance; that I might bring them to taste of the exceeding joy of which I did taste. \u2026<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162706435\" id=\"p_bhuRQ\">\u201c\u2026 And \u2026 the Lord doth give me exceedingly great joy in the fruit of my labors. \u2026<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162706443\" id=\"p_mk6li\">\u201cAnd I have been supported under trials and troubles of every kind.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"8\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162706451\" id=\"p_i0LgL\">Joy in Christ began for Alma when he exercised faith in Him and cried for mercy. Then Alma exercised his faith in Christ by laboring to help others taste of the same joy. These continuous labors produced great joy in Alma even in trials and troubles of every kind. You see, \u201cthe Lord loves effort,\u201d and effort focused on Him brings blessings.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"9\"><\/sup><\/a> Even severe trials can be \u201cswallowed up in the joy of Christ.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"10\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162706458\" id=\"p_uNX7p\">Another group in the Book of Mormon who made Jesus Christ and His gospel the focus of their lives and found joy are those who founded the city Helam\u2014a place where they could raise their children and enjoy the free exercise of their religion. This righteous people living good lives were enslaved by a marauding group and stripped of the fundamental human right to exercise religion. Sometimes bad things happen to good people:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162706465\" id=\"p_kDzHu\">\u201cThe Lord seeth fit to chasten his people; yea, he trieth their patience and their faith.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162706472\" id=\"p_qmVxS\">\u201cNevertheless\u2014whosoever putteth his trust in him the same shall be lifted up at the last day.

By focusing on Christ and His gospel.
