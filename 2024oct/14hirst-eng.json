Hirst<\/p>\n<p class=\"author-role\" data-aid=\"162704660\" id=\"p_r00H8\">Of the Seventy<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"kicker\" data-aid=\"162704662\" id=\"p_qWmf6\">Being filled with God\u2019s love shields us in life\u2019s storms but also makes the happy moments happier.<\/p>\n<\/header>\n<div class=\"body-block\">\n<p data-aid=\"162704664\" id=\"p_a6Nvd\">Before I begin, I should tell you that two of my children have passed out whilst speaking at pulpits, and I have never felt more connected to them than in this moment. I\u2019ve got more on my mind than just the trapdoor.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704666\" id=\"p_k3hfL\">Our family has six children, who sometimes tease one another that they are the favourite child. Each has different reasons for being preferred. Our love for each of our children is pure and fulfilling and complete. We could not love any one of them any more than another\u2014with each child\u2019s birth came the most beautiful expansion of our love. I most relate to my Heavenly Father\u2019s love for me through the love that I feel for my children.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704668\" id=\"p_iNmkv\">As they each rehearse their claims to be the most loved child, you might have thought that our family had never had an untidy bedroom. The sense of blemishes in the relationship between parent and child is diminished with a focus on love.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704670\" id=\"p_c1pZB\">At some point, perhaps because I can see that we are heading toward an inevitable family riot, I\u2019ll say something like, \u201cOK, you have worn me down, but I am not going to announce it; you know which one of you is my favourite.\u201d My goal is that each one of the six feels victorious and all-out war is avoided\u2014at least until next time!<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704673\" id=\"p_pccqz\">In his Gospel, John describes himself as \u201cthe disciple whom Jesus loved,\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"1\"><\/sup><\/a> as if that arrangement were somehow unique. I like to think that this was because John felt so completely loved by Jesus. Nephi gave me a similar sense when he wrote, \u201cI glory in <em>my<\/em> Jesus.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"2\"><\/sup><\/a> Of course, the Saviour isn\u2019t Nephi\u2019s any more than He is John\u2019s, and yet the personal nature of Nephi\u2019s relationship with \u201chis\u201d Jesus led him to that tender description.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704675\" id=\"p_fIFOH\">Isn\u2019t it wonderful that there are times when we can feel so fully and personally noticed and loved? Nephi can call Him \u201chis\u201d Jesus, and so can we. Our Saviour\u2019s love is the \u201chighest, noblest, strongest kind of love,\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"3\"><\/sup><\/a> and He provides until we are \u201cfilled.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"4\"><\/sup><\/a> Divine love never runs dry, and we are each a cherished favourite. God\u2019s love is where, as circles on a Venn diagram, we all overlap. Whichever parts of us seem different, His love is where we find togetherness.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704677\" id=\"p_lKbYL\">Is it any surprise that the greatest commandments are to love God and to love those around us?<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"5\"><\/sup><\/a> When I see people showing Christlike love for one another, it feels to me as if that love contains more than just <em>their<\/em> love; it is love that also has divinity in it.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"6\"><\/sup><\/a> When we love one another in this way, as completely and fully as we can, heaven gets involved too.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"7\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704679\" id=\"p_e32LK\">So if someone we care about seems distant from a sense of divine love, we can follow this pattern\u2014by doing things that bring us closer to God ourselves and then doing things that bring us closer to them\u2014an unspoken beckoning to come to Christ.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704682\" id=\"p_wDdgx\">I wish I could sit down with you and ask you what circumstances cause you to feel God\u2019s love. Which verses of scripture, which particular acts of service? Where would you be? What music? In whose company? General conference is a rich place to learn about connecting with heaven\u2019s love.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704683\" id=\"p_lcdv2\">But perhaps you feel a long way from the love of God. Maybe there is a chorus of voices of discouragement and darkness that weighs into your thoughts, messages telling you that you are too wounded and confused, too weak and overlooked, too different or disoriented to warrant heavenly love in any real way. If you hear those ideas, then please hear this: those voices are just wrong. We can confidently disregard brokenness in any way disqualifying us from heavenly love\u2014every time we sing the hymn that reminds us that our beloved and flawless Saviour chose to be \u201cbruised, broken, [and] torn for us,\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"8\"><\/sup><\/a> every time we take broken bread. Surely Jesus removes all shame from the broken. Through His brokenness, He became perfect, and He can make us perfect in spite of our brokenness.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"9\"><\/sup><\/a> Broken, lonely, torn, and bruised He was\u2014and we may feel we are\u2014but separated from the love of God we are not. \u201cBroken people, perfect love,\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"10\"><\/sup><\/a> as the song goes.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704685\" id=\"p_k9DeF\">You might know something secret about yourself that makes you feel unlovable. However right you might be about what you know about yourself, you are wrong to think that you have put yourself beyond the reach of God\u2019s love. We are sometimes cruel and impatient toward ourselves in ways that we could never imagine being toward anyone else. There is much for us to do in this life, but self-loathing and shameful self-condemnation are not on that list. However misshapen <em>we<\/em> might feel <em>we<\/em> are, <em>His<\/em> arms are not shortened.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"11\"><\/sup><\/a> No. They are always long enough to \u201c[reach our] reaching\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"12\"><\/sup><\/a> and embrace each one of us.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704687\" id=\"p_rzIlz\">When we don\u2019t feel the warmth of divine love, it hasn\u2019t gone away. God\u2019s own words are that \u201cthe mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but [His] kindness shall not depart from [us].\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"13\"><\/sup><\/a> So, just to be clear, the idea that God has stopped loving should be so far down the list of possible explanations in life that we don\u2019t get to it until after the mountains have left and the hills are gone!<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704689\" id=\"p_ua9JK\">I really enjoy this symbolism of mountains being evidence of the certainty of God\u2019s love. That powerful symbolism weaves into accounts of those who go to the mountains to receive revelation<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note14\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"14\"><\/sup><\/a> and Isaiah\u2019s description of \u201cthe mountain of the Lord\u2019s house\u201d being \u201cestablished in the top of the mountains.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note15\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"15\"><\/sup><\/a> The house of the Lord is the home of our most precious covenants and a place for us all to retreat<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note16\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"16\"><\/sup><\/a> and sink deeply into the evidence of our Father\u2019s love for us.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note17\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"17\"><\/sup><\/a> I have also enjoyed the comfort that comes to my soul when I wrap myself more tightly in my baptismal covenant and find someone who is mourning a loss or grieving a disappointment and I try to help them hold and process their feelings.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note18\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"18\"><\/sup><\/a> Are these ways that we can become more immersed in the precious covenantal love <em>hesed<\/em>?<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note19\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"19\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704698\" id=\"p_ySmdU\">So if God\u2019s love does not leave us, why don\u2019t we always feel it? Just to manage your expectations: I don\u2019t know. But <em>being<\/em> loved is definitely not the same as <em>feeling<\/em> loved, and I have a few thoughts that might help you as you pursue your answers to that question.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704700\" id=\"p_vrSNA\">Perhaps you are wrestling with grief, depression, betrayal, loneliness, disappointment, or other powerful intrusion into your ability to feel God\u2019s love for you. If so, these things can dull or suspend our ability to feel as we might otherwise feel. For a season at least, perhaps you will not be able to <em>feel<\/em> His love, and knowledge will have to suffice. But I wonder if you could experiment\u2014patiently\u2014with different ways of expressing and receiving divine love. Can you take a step back from whatever is in front of you and maybe another step and another, until you see a wider landscape, wider and wider still if necessary, until you are literally \u201cthinking celestial\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note20\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"20\"><\/sup><\/a> because you are looking at the stars and remembering worlds without number and through them their Creator?<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704703\" id=\"p_jXA98\">Birdsong, feeling the sun or a breeze or rain on my skin, and times when nature puts my senses in awe of God\u2014each has had a part in providing me with heavenly connection. Perhaps the comfort of faithful friends will help. Maybe music? Or serving? Have you kept a record or journal of times when your connection with God was clearer to you? Perhaps you could invite those you trust to share their sources of divine connection with you as you search for relief and understanding.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704706\" id=\"p_ib6fq\">I wonder, if Jesus were to choose a place where you and He could meet, a private place where you would be able to have a singular focus on Him, might He choose your unique place of personal suffering, the place of your deepest need, where no one else can go? Somewhere you feel so lonely that you must truly be all alone but you aren\u2019t quite, a place to which perhaps only He has travelled but actually has already prepared to meet you there when you arrive?
