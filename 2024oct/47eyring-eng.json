Eyring<\/p>\n<p class=\"author-role\" data-aid=\"162704900\" id=\"p_pjmoc\">Second Counselor in the First Presidency<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"kicker\" data-aid=\"162704912\" id=\"p_dxKaQ\">I bear witness of the sacred work of teaching Heavenly Father\u2019s children the simple doctrine of Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n<\/header>\n<div class=\"body-block\">\n<p data-aid=\"162704925\" id=\"p_cVWKf\">All of us have family members we love who are being tempted and tried by the seemingly constant forces of Satan, the destroyer, who would make all God\u2019s children miserable. For many of us, there have been sleepless nights. We have tried to surround the people who are at risk with every force for good. We have pled in prayer for them. We have loved them. We have set the best example we could.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704929\" id=\"p_e4QH3\">Alma, a wise prophet from ancient times, faced similar trials. The people he led and loved were frequently under attack by a ferocious enemy, yet they were still trying to rear righteous children in a world of wickedness. Alma felt his only hope of victory was a force which at times we underestimate and often use too little. He pled for God\u2019s help.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704938\" id=\"p_nNlir\">Alma knew that for God to help, repentance was required by those he led, as well as his adversaries. Thus, he opted for a different approach to battle.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704947\" id=\"p_tzMzP\">The Book of Mormon describes it this way: \u201cAnd now, as the preaching of the word had a great tendency to lead the people to do that which was just\u2014yea, it had \u2026 more powerful effect upon the minds of the people than the sword, or anything else, which had happened unto them\u2014therefore Alma thought it was expedient that they should try the virtue of the word of God.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"1\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704956\" id=\"p_dAyPz\">The word of God is the doctrine taught by Jesus Christ and by His prophets. Alma knew that the words of doctrine had great power.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704965\" id=\"p_lH4uQ\">In the <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/18?lang=eng\">18th section of the Doctrine and Covenants<\/a>, the Lord revealed the foundation of His doctrine:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704974\" id=\"p_n0uuP\">\u201cFor, behold, I command all men everywhere to repent. \u2026<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704982\" id=\"p_xUSXK\">\u201cFor, behold, the Lord your Redeemer suffered death in the flesh; wherefore he suffered the pain of all men, that all men might repent and come unto him.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704990\" id=\"p_ntOAg\">\u201cAnd he hath risen again from the dead, that he might bring all men unto him, on conditions of repentance.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"2\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162704998\" id=\"p_yuo64\">\u201cAnd you shall fall down and worship the Father in my name.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705006\" id=\"p_j2kQM\">\u201c\u2026 You must repent and be baptized, in the name of Jesus Christ.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"3\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705014\" id=\"p_oAC1h\">\u201cAsk the Father in my name in faith, believing that you shall receive, and you shall have the Holy Ghost.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"4\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705024\" id=\"p_dmw8P\">\u201cAnd now, after \u2026 you have received this, you must keep my commandments in all things.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"5\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705030\" id=\"p_bcXdt\">\u201cTake upon you the name of Christ, and speak the truth in soberness.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705038\" id=\"p_j3FzW\">\u201cAnd as many as repent and are baptized in my name, which is Jesus Christ, and endure to the end, the same shall be saved.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"6\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705046\" id=\"p_rl0tj\">In those few passages, the Savior gives us the perfect example of how we should teach His doctrine. This doctrine is that faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, repentance, baptism, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and enduring to the end blesses all of God\u2019s children.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705053\" id=\"p_cdx6v\">As we teach these principles to those we love, the Holy Ghost will help us to know the truth. Because we need the promptings of the Holy Ghost, we must avoid speculation or personal interpretation that goes beyond teaching true doctrine.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705088\" id=\"p_i8b34\">That can be hard to do when you love the person you are trying to influence. He or she may have ignored the doctrine that has been taught. It is tempting to try something new or sensational. But the Holy Ghost will reveal the spirit of truth only as we are cautious and careful not to go beyond teaching true doctrine. One of the surest ways to avoid even getting near false doctrine is to choose to be simple in our teaching. Safety is gained by that simplicity, and little is lost.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705096\" id=\"p_rnKSS\">Teaching simply allows us to share the saving doctrine early on, while children remain untouched by the deceiver\u2019s temptations that will later confront them, long before the truths they need to learn are drowned out by the noise of social media, peers, and their own personal struggles. We should seize every opportunity to share the teachings of Jesus Christ with children. These teaching moments are precious and far fewer compared to the relentless efforts of opposing forces. For every hour spent instilling doctrine into a child\u2019s life, there are countless hours of opposition filled with messages and images that challenge or ignore those saving truths.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705103\" id=\"p_wcAH6\">Some of you may wonder whether it might be better to draw your children closer to you through having fun, or you may ask whether the child may start to feel overwhelmed by your teachings. Instead, we should consider, \u201cWith so little time and so few opportunities, what words of doctrine can I share that will strengthen them against the inevitable challenges to their faith?\u201d The words you share today could be the ones they carry with them, and today will soon pass.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705110\" id=\"p_zgZSd\">I have always admired my great-grandmother Mary Bommeli\u2019s devotion to sharing the doctrine of Jesus Christ. Her family was taught by missionaries in Switzerland when she was 24.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705117\" id=\"p_ggXiS\">After being baptized, Mary desired to join the Saints in America, so she made her way from Switzerland to Berlin and found work with a woman who employed her to weave cloth for the family\u2019s clothing. Mary lived in a servant\u2019s room and set up her loom in the home\u2019s living area.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705124\" id=\"p_h1AF8\">At that time, teaching the doctrine of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was illegal in Berlin. But Mary found she could not keep from sharing the things she had learned. The woman of the house and her friends would gather around the loom to hear Mary teach. She spoke of the appearance of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ to Joseph Smith, the visitation of angels, and the Book of Mormon. Remembering the accounts of Alma, she taught about the doctrine of the Resurrection. She testified that families can be reunited in the celestial kingdom.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705131\" id=\"p_ee5f6\">Mary\u2019s enthusiasm to share the doctrine of the restored gospel soon caused trouble. It was not long before the police took Mary off to jail. On the way, she asked the policeman for the name of the judge she was to appear before the next morning. She also asked about his family and if he was a good father and husband. The policeman described the judge as a man of the world.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705138\" id=\"p_tCkOQ\">In the jail, Mary requested a pencil and some paper. She spent the night writing a letter to the judge, bearing witness to the Resurrection of Jesus Christ as described in the Book of Mormon, discussing the spirit world, and explaining repentance. She suggested that the judge would need time to reflect on his life before facing final judgment. She wrote that she knew he had much to repent of, much which would deeply sadden his family and bring him great sorrow. In the morning, when she had finished her letter, she gave it to the policeman and asked him to deliver it to the judge, and he agreed to do so.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705143\" id=\"p_nIroE\">Later, the policeman was summoned by the judge to his office. The letter Mary had written was irrefutable evidence that she was teaching the doctrine of the restored gospel and, by so doing, breaking the law. However, it wasn\u2019t long before the policeman returned to Mary\u2019s cell. He told her that all charges were dismissed and that she was free to go. Her teaching the doctrine of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ had caused her to be cast into jail. And her declaring the doctrine of repentance to the judge got her cast out of jail.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"7\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705148\" id=\"p_jwkd8\">Mary Bommeli\u2019s teaching did not end with her release. The record of her words passed true doctrine down through generations yet unborn. Her belief that even a new convert could teach the doctrine of Jesus Christ has ensured that her descendants will be strengthened in their own battles.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705155\" id=\"p_prbSR\">As we do our best to teach those we love about the doctrine of Jesus Christ, some may still not respond. Doubts may creep into your mind. You might question whether you know the Savior\u2019s doctrine well enough to teach it effectively. And if you\u2019ve already made attempts to teach it, you may wonder why the positive effects aren\u2019t more visible. Don\u2019t give in to those doubts. Turn to God for help.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705162\" id=\"p_nJACO\">\u201cYea, and cry unto God for all thy support; \u2026 let the affections of thy heart be placed upon the Lord forever.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"8\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705169\" id=\"p_nVfVl\">\u201cAnd now I would that ye should be humble, and be submissive and gentle; easy to be entreated; full of patience and long-suffering; being temperate in all things; being diligent in keeping the commandments of God at all times; asking for whatsoever things ye stand in need, both spiritual and temporal; always returning thanks unto God for whatsoever things ye do receive.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"9\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705176\" id=\"p_q0Yd5\">If you pray, if you talk to God, and if you plead for His help for your loved one, and if you thank Him not only for help but for the patience and gentleness that come from not receiving all you desire right away or perhaps ever, then I promise you that you will draw closer to Him. You will become diligent and long-suffering. And then you can know that you have done all that you can to help those you love and those you pray for navigate through Satan\u2019s attempt to derail them.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705183\" id=\"p_a4GxK\">\u201cBut they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"10\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705190\" id=\"p_aKf1E\">You can find hope in the scriptural record of families. We read of those who turned away from what they were taught or who were wrestling with God for forgiveness, such as Alma the Younger, the sons of Mosiah, and Enos. In their moments of crisis, they remembered the words of their parents, words of the doctrine of Jesus Christ. Remembering saved them. Your teaching of that sacred doctrine will be remembered.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705196\" id=\"p_lYG7M\">I bear witness of the sacred work of teaching Heavenly Father\u2019s children the simple doctrine of Jesus Christ, which allows us to be spiritually cleansed and ultimately be welcomed into God\u2019s presence, to live with Him and His Son in glory forever in families. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<footer class=\"notes\">\n<p class=\"title\" data-aid=\"162705202\" id=\"p_jvVqn\">Notes<\/p>\n<ol class=\"decimal\" data-type=\"marker\" start=\"1\">\n<li data-marker=\"1.\" id=\"note1\" data-full-marker=\"1.\">\n<p data-aid=\"162705208\" id=\"p_hI3bf\"><a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/31?lang=eng&amp;id=p5#p5\">Alma 31:5<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"2.\" id=\"note2\" data-full-marker=\"2.\">\n<p data-aid=\"162705214\" id=\"p_u0KAE\"><a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/18?lang=eng&amp;id=p9%2C11-p12#p9\">Doctrine and Covenants 18:9, 11\u201312<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"3.\" id=\"note3\" data-full-marker=\"3.\">\n<p data-aid=\"162705220\" id=\"p_pppx2\"><a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/18?lang=eng&amp;id=p40-p41#p40\">Doctrine and Covenants 18:40\u201341<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"4.\" id=\"note4\" data-full-marker=\"4.\">\n<p data-aid=\"162705226\" id=\"p_sYTOk\"><a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/18?lang=eng&amp;id=p18#p18\">Doctrine and Covenants 18:18<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"5.\" id=\"note5\" data-full-marker=\"5.\">\n<p data-aid=\"162705232\" id=\"p_jDdzr\"><a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/18?lang=eng&amp;id=p43#p43\">Doctrine and Covenants 18:43<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"6.\" id=\"note6\" data-full-marker=\"6.\">\n<p data-aid=\"162705238\" id=\"p_a8Bmf\"><a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/18?lang=eng&amp;id=p21-p22#p21\">Doctrine and Covenants 18:21\u201322<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"7.\" id=\"note7\" data-full-marker=\"7.\">\n<p data-aid=\"162705243\" id=\"p_vjjJZ\">See Theresa Snow Hill, <cite>Life and Times of Henry Eyring and Mary Bommeli<\/cite> (1997), 15\u201322.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"8.\" id=\"note8\" data-full-marker=\"8.\">\n<p data-aid=\"162705248\" id=\"p_dCvHg\"><a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/37?lang=eng&amp;id=p36#p36\">Alma 37:36<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"9.\" id=\"note9\" data-full-marker=\"9.\">\n<p data-aid=\"162705252\" id=\"p_w43kq\"><a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/7?lang=eng&amp;id=p23#p23\">Alma 7:23<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"10.\" id=\"note10\" data-full-marker=\"10.\">\n<p data-aid=\"162705256\" id=\"p_vV5cG\"><a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/ot/isa/40?lang=eng&amp;id=p31#p31\">Isaiah 40:31<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/footer>",
