In the April 2019 general conference, moments after I was sustained in my new responsibility as a General Authority Seventy, the choir sang a rendition of \u201cI Stand All Amazed\u201d that pierced my heart and soul.<\/p>\n<div class=\"poetry\">\n<div class=\"stanza\">\n<p class=\"line\" data-aid=\"162705691\" id=\"p_nT5IM\">I marvel that he would descend from his throne divine<\/p>\n<p class=\"line\" data-aid=\"162705697\" id=\"p_lrpYm\">To rescue a soul so rebellious and proud as mine,<\/p>\n<p class=\"line\" data-aid=\"162705700\" id=\"p_h4M3v\">That he should extend his great love unto such as I,<\/p>\n<p class=\"line\" data-aid=\"162705706\" id=\"p_s5hiA\">Sufficient to own, to redeem, and to justify.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"1\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p data-aid=\"162705711\" id=\"p_s1F6z\">As I heard those words, I was all amazed. I felt that despite my inadequacies and flaws, the Lord blessed me to know that \u201cin his strength I can do all things.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"2\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705716\" id=\"p_mkdzi\">The common feeling of inadequacy, weakness, or even unworthiness is something with which many of us sometimes struggle. I still struggle with this; I felt it the day I was called. I have felt it many times, and I still feel it right now speaking to you. However, I have learned that I am not alone with these feelings. In fact, there are many accounts in the scriptures of those who seem to have felt similar feelings. For example, we remember Nephi as a faithful and valiant servant of the Lord. At times, even he struggled with feelings of unworthiness, weakness, and inadequacy.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705722\" id=\"p_tDYNO\">He said: \u201cNotwithstanding the great goodness of the Lord, in showing me his great and marvelous works, my heart exclaimeth: O wretched man that I am! Yea, my heart sorroweth because of my flesh; my soul grieveth because of mine iniquities.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"3\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705728\" id=\"p_rObwm\">The Prophet Joseph Smith spoke of often feeling \u201ccondemned,\u201d in his youth, \u201cfor [his] weakness and imperfections.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"4\"><\/sup><\/a> But Joseph\u2019s feelings of inadequacy and worry were part of what led him to ponder, study, learn, and pray. As you may remember, he went to pray in the grove near his home to find truth, peace, and forgiveness. He heard the Lord say: \u201cJoseph, my son, thy sins are forgiven thee. Go thy way, walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments. Behold, I am the Lord of Glory. I was crucified for the world that all those who believe on my name may have eternal life.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"5\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705734\" id=\"p_nNa4V\">Joseph\u2019s sincere desire to repent and seek the salvation of his soul helped him come to Jesus Christ and receive forgiveness of his sins. This continuous effort opened the door to the continuing Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705738\" id=\"p_cwZcX\">This remarkable experience of the Prophet Joseph Smith illustrates how feelings of weakness and inadequacy can help us recognize our fallen nature. If we are humble, this will help us come to recognize our dependence upon Jesus Christ and stir within our hearts a sincere desire to turn to the Savior and repent of our sins.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"6\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705745\" id=\"p_eP89s\">My friends, repentance is joy!<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"7\"><\/sup><\/a> Sweet repentance is part of a daily process through which, \u201cline upon line, precept upon precept,\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"8\"><\/sup><\/a> the Lord teaches us to live a life centered in His teachings. Like Joseph and Nephi, we can \u201ccry unto [God] for mercy; for he is mighty to save.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"9\"><\/sup><\/a> He can fulfill any righteous desire or longing and can heal any wound in our lives.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705751\" id=\"p_vsB1L\">In the Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ, you and I can find countless accounts of individuals who learned how to come unto Christ through sincere repentance.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705758\" id=\"p_o4muo\">I\u2019d like to share with you an example of the tender mercies of the Lord through an experience that occurred in my beloved home island of Puerto Rico.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705765\" id=\"p_bmcyd\">It was in my hometown of Ponce that a sister in the Church, Célia Cruz Ayala, decided that she was going to give a Book of Mormon to a friend. She wrapped it and went to deliver this gift, more precious to her than diamonds or rubies, she said.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"10\"><\/sup><\/a> On her way, a thief approached her, grabbed her purse, and ran away with the special gift inside.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705771\" id=\"p_vHozc\">When she told this story at church, her friend said, \u201cWho knows? Maybe this was your opportunity to share the gospel!\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705779\" id=\"p_rrMHR\">Well, a few days later, do you know what happened? Célia received a letter. I hold that letter, which Célia shared with me, in my hand today. It says:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705786\" id=\"p_bdPxL\">\u201cMrs. Cruz:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705792\" id=\"p_g46DK\">\u201cForgive me, forgive me. You will never know how sorry I am for attacking you. But because of it, my life has changed and will continue to change.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705799\" id=\"p_jsnat\">\u201cThat book [the Book of Mormon] has helped me in my life. The dream of that man of God has shaken me. \u2026 I am returning your five [dollars,] for I can\u2019t spend them. I want you to know that you seemed to have a radiance about you. That light seemed to stop me [from harming you, so] I ran away instead.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705806\" id=\"p_xvIrK\">\u201cI want you to know that you will see me again, but when you do, you won\u2019t recognize me, for I will be your brother. \u2026 Here, where I live, I have to find the Lord and go to the church you belong to.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705812\" id=\"p_dI4CO\">\u201cThe message you wrote in that book brought tears to my eyes. Since Wednesday night I have not been able to stop reading it. I have prayed and asked God to forgive me [and] I ask you to forgive me. \u2026 I thought your wrapped gift was something I could sell. [Instead,] it has made me want to [change] my life. \u2026 Forgive me, forgive me, I beg you.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705819\" id=\"p_c7beK\">\u201cYour absent friend.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"11\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705827\" id=\"p_hlLdr\">Brothers and sisters, the light of the Savior can reach us all, no matter our circumstances. \u201cIt is not possible for you to sink lower than the infinite light of Christ\u2019s Atonement shines,\u201d said President Jeffrey R.

Serving regularly in the house of the Lord and striving to keep the sacred covenants we make there will increase both our desire and our ability to experience the change of heart, might, mind, and soul necessary for us to become more like our Savior. President Russell M. Nelson has testified: \u201cNothing will open the heavens <em>more<\/em> [than worshipping in the temple].

Let us not wait for things to get hard before turning to God. Let us not wait until the end of our mortal lives to truly repent.
