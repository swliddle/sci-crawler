McKay<\/p>\n<p class=\"author-role\" data-aid=\"162705662\" id=\"p_sqXfx\">Of the Seventy<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"kicker\" data-aid=\"162705669\" id=\"p_gqMyx\">Joseph Smith was \u201cblessed to open the last dispensation,\u201d and we are blessed that he did.<\/p>\n<\/header>\n<div class=\"body-block\">\n<p data-aid=\"162705674\" id=\"p_ceRXL\">My purpose this day and always is to testify of Jesus Christ, that He is the Son of God, the Creator and Savior of the world, our Deliverer and Redeemer. Because \u201cthe fundamental principles of our religion are the testimony of the Apostles and Prophets, concerning Jesus Christ,\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"1\"><\/sup><\/a> today I share with you my knowledge and testimony of the Savior as they have been strengthened and deepened by the life and teachings of one key apostle and prophet.<\/p>\n<section id=\"sec_gmSDH\">\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"162705680\" id=\"p_kxglo\">The Beginning of Wisdom<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"162705686\" id=\"p_wGtJn\">On the morning of a beautiful clear day early in the spring of 1820, 14-year-old Joseph Smith entered a grove of trees near his family\u2019s home to pray about his sins and to ask which church to join. His sincere prayer, offered with unwavering faith, received the attention of the most powerful forces in the universe, including the Father and the Son. And the devil. Each of these had an intense interest in that prayer and in that boy.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705690\" id=\"p_gUMKE\">What we now call the First Vision marked the beginning of the Restoration of all things in this last dispensation. But for Joseph, the experience was also personal and preparatory. All he wanted was forgiveness and direction. The Lord gave him both. The instruction to \u201cjoin none of [the churches]\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"2\"><\/sup><\/a> was directive. The words \u201cThy sins are forgiven thee\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"3\"><\/sup><\/a> were redemptive.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705695\" id=\"p_oq5ew\">For all the beautiful truths we might learn from that First Vision, perhaps Joseph\u2019s main takeaway was simply, \u201cI had found the testimony of James to be true\u2014that a man who lacked wisdom might ask of God, and obtain.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"4\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705701\" id=\"p_siV2A\">As one scholar noted: \u201cThe real resonance of the First Vision today is to know that it\u2019s the nature of God to give to those who lack wisdom. \u2026 The God that reveals Himself to Joseph Smith in the sacred grove is a God who answers teenagers in times of trouble.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"5\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705705\" id=\"p_txIPa\">Joseph\u2019s experience in the grove gave him confidence to ask for <em>forgiveness<\/em> and <em>direction<\/em> for the rest of his life. His experience has also given <em>me<\/em> confidence to ask for forgiveness and direction for the rest of my life.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"sec_fAQSJ\">\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"162705710\" id=\"p_yLR4u\">Regular Repentance<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"162705714\" id=\"p_yXauT\">On September 21, 1823, Joseph earnestly prayed for forgiveness, confident that because of his experience in the grove three years earlier, heaven would respond again.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"6\"><\/sup><\/a> And it did. The Lord sent an angel, Moroni, to instruct Joseph and inform him of an ancient record he would later translate by the gift and power of God\u2014the Book of Mormon.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705719\" id=\"p_emH8l\">Almost 13 years after that, Joseph and Oliver Cowdery knelt in solemn, silent prayer in the newly dedicated Kirtland Temple. We do not know what they prayed for, but their prayers likely included a plea for forgiveness, for, as they arose, the Savior appeared and declared, \u201cBehold, your sins are forgiven you; you are clean before me.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"7\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705724\" id=\"p_hn4ub\">In the months and years after this experience, Joseph and Oliver would sin again. And again. But in that moment, <em>for<\/em> that moment, in response to their plea and in preparation for the glorious restoration of priesthood keys that was about to happen, Jesus made them sinless.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705729\" id=\"p_iIkQy\">Joseph\u2019s life of regular repentance gives me confidence to \u201ccome boldly unto the throne of grace, that [I] may obtain mercy.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"8\"><\/sup><\/a> I have learned that Jesus Christ truly is \u201cof a forgiving disposition.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"9\"><\/sup><\/a> It is neither His mission nor His nature to condemn.
