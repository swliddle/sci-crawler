You are devoted disciples of Jesus Christ who are eager to learn. I commend you for your faithfulness. And I love you.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705774\" id=\"p_uTs8u\">Ezra Taft Benson served as the President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints from November 1985 until May 1994. I was 33 years old when President Benson became the President of the Church and 42 when he passed away. And his teachings and testimony influenced me in profound and powerful ways.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705780\" id=\"p_fcuXF\">One of the hallmarks of President Benson\u2019s ministry was his focus upon the purpose and importance of the Book of Mormon. He emphasized repeatedly that \u201cthe Book of Mormon is the keystone of our religion\u2014the keystone of our testimony, the keystone of our doctrine, and the keystone in the witness of our Lord and Savior.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"1\"><\/sup><\/a> He also often emphasized teachings and warnings about the sin of pride found in this latter-day testament of Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705789\" id=\"p_t2gjr\">A particular teaching by President Benson greatly impacted me and continues to influence my study of the Book of Mormon. He said:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705794\" id=\"p_pg3SR\">\u201cThe Book of Mormon \u2026 was written for our day. The Nephites never had the book; neither did the Lamanites of ancient times. It was meant for us. Mormon wrote near the end of the Nephite civilization. Under the inspiration of God, who sees all things from the beginning, [Mormon] abridged centuries of records, choosing the stories, speeches, and events that would be most helpful to us.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705803\" id=\"p_w0FPr\">President Benson continued: \u201cEach of the major writers of the Book of Mormon testified that he wrote for future generations. \u2026 If they saw our day, and chose those things which would be of greatest worth to us, is not that how we should study the Book of Mormon? We should constantly ask ourselves, \u2018Why did the Lord inspire Mormon \u2026 to include [this account] in his record? What lesson can I learn from [this admonition] to help me live in this day and age?\u2019\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"2\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705808\" id=\"p_sZgFy\">President Benson\u2019s statements help us to understand that the Book of Mormon is not primarily a historical record that looks to the past. Rather, this volume of scripture looks to the future and contains important principles, warnings, and lessons intended for the circumstances and challenges of our day. Hence, the Book of Mormon is a book about our future and the times in which we do now and will yet live.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705813\" id=\"p_dWjeR\">I pray for the assistance of the Holy Ghost as we now consider relevant lessons for us today from the book of Helaman in the Book of Mormon.<\/p>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"162705820\" id=\"p_bKwLe\">The Nephites and the Lamanites<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"162705830\" id=\"p_kYUPd\">The record of Helaman and his sons describes a people who were anticipating the birth of Jesus Christ. The half century recounted in the scriptural record highlights the conversion and righteousness of the Lamanites and the wickedness, apostasy, and abominations of the Nephites.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705837\" id=\"p_gHyLO\">A series of comparisons and contrasts between the Nephites and Lamanites from this ancient record are most instructive for us today.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705845\" id=\"p_jsynz\">\u201cThe Lamanites had become, the more part of them, a righteous people, insomuch that their righteousness did exceed that of the Nephites, because of their firmness and their steadiness in the faith.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705848\" id=\"p_gCbc0\">\u201c[And] there were many of the Nephites who had become hardened and impenitent and grossly wicked, insomuch that they did reject the word of God and all the preaching and prophesying which did come among them.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"3\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705855\" id=\"p_wBlBV\">\u201cAnd thus we see that the Nephites did begin to dwindle in unbelief, and grow in wickedness and abominations, while the Lamanites began to grow exceedingly in the knowledge of their God; yea, they did begin to keep his statutes and commandments, and to walk in truth and uprightness before him.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705863\" id=\"p_bUAbJ\">\u201cAnd thus we see that the Spirit of the Lord began to withdraw from the Nephites, because of the wickedness and the hardness of their hearts.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705871\" id=\"p_eRqen\">\u201cAnd thus we see that the Lord began to pour out his Spirit upon the Lamanites, because of their easiness and willingness to believe in his words.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"4\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705879\" id=\"p_nkPVG\">Perhaps the most stunning and sobering aspect of this decline into apostasy by the Nephites is the fact that \u201call these iniquities did come unto them in the space of not many years.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"5\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"162705888\" id=\"p_kx4WT\">The Nephites Turned Away from God<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"162705893\" id=\"p_vAlOo\">How could a once-righteous people become hardened and wicked in such a short period of time? How could people so quickly forget the God who had blessed them so abundantly?<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705903\" id=\"p_qBnL6\">In a powerful and profound way, the negative example of the Nephites is instructive for us today.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705910\" id=\"p_wTt6u\">\u201cPride \u2026 began to enter \u2026 into the hearts of the people who professed to belong to the church of God \u2026 because of their exceedingly great riches and their prosperity in the land.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"6\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705917\" id=\"p_jEFOy\">\u201c[They] set [their] hearts upon the riches and the vain things of this world\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"7\"><\/sup><\/a> \u201cbecause of that pride which [they] \u2026 suffered to enter [into their] hearts, which \u2026 lifted [them] up beyond that which is good because of [their] exceedingly great riches!\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"8\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705926\" id=\"p_r6yPg\">Ancient voices from the dust plead with us today to learn this everlasting lesson: prosperity, possessions, and ease<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"9\"><\/sup><\/a> constitute a potent mixture that can lead even the righteous to drink the spiritual poison of pride.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705935\" id=\"p_wrHdC\">Allowing pride to enter into our hearts can cause us to mock that which is sacred;<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"10\"><\/sup><\/a> disbelieve in the spirit of prophecy and revelation;<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"11\"><\/sup><\/a> trample under our feet the commandments of God;<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"12\"><\/sup><\/a> deny the word of God;<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"13\"><\/sup><\/a> cast out, mock,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note14\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"14\"><\/sup><\/a> and revile against the prophets;<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note15\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"15\"><\/sup><\/a> and forget the Lord our God<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note16\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"16\"><\/sup><\/a> and \u201cnot desire that the Lord [our] God, who hath created [us], should rule and reign over [us].\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note17\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"17\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705944\" id=\"p_yTg1D\">Therefore, if we are not faithful and obedient, we can transform the God-given blessing of prosperity into a prideful curse that diverts and distracts us from eternal truths and vital spiritual priorities. We always must be on guard against a pride-induced and exaggerated sense of self-importance, a misguided evaluation of our own self-sufficiency, and seeking self instead of serving others.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705952\" id=\"p_oO3If\">As we pridefully focus upon ourselves, we also are afflicted with spiritual blindness and miss much, most, or perhaps all that is occurring within and around us.
