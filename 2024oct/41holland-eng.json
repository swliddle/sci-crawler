Holland<\/p>\n<p class=\"author-role\" data-aid=\"162705762\" id=\"p_n9aFv\">Acting President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"kicker\" data-aid=\"162705769\" id=\"p_oTQQb\">Christ\u2019s charity\u2014evident in complete loyalty to divine will\u2014persisted and continues to persist.<\/p>\n<\/header>\n<div class=\"body-block\">\n<p data-aid=\"162705776\" id=\"p_pi5pW\">It is the Sabbath day, and we have gathered to speak of Christ and Him crucified. I know that my Redeemer lives.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705783\" id=\"p_mYRS5\">Consider this scene from the last week of Jesus\u2019s mortal life. A multitude had gathered, including Roman soldiers armed with staves and strapped with swords. Led by officers from the chief priests who had torches in hand, this earnest company was <em>not<\/em> off to conquer a city.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"1\"><\/sup><\/a> Tonight they were looking for only one man, a man not known to carry a weapon, receive military training, or engage in physical combat at any time in His entire life.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705790\" id=\"p_dPGH2\">As the soldiers approached, Jesus, in an effort to protect His disciples, stepped forth and said, \u201cWhom seek ye?\u201d They replied, \u201cJesus of Nazareth.\u201d Jesus said, \u201cI am he. \u2026 As soon \u2026 as he had said unto them, I am he, they went backward, and fell to the ground.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"2\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705797\" id=\"p_yLG9M\">To me, that is one of the most stirring lines in all of scripture. Among other things, it tells me straightforwardly that <em>just being in the presence<\/em> of the Son of God\u2014the great Jehovah of the Old Testament and Good Shepherd of the New, who bears no weapons of any kind\u2014that <em>just hearing the voice<\/em> of this Refuge from the Storm, this Prince of Peace, is enough to send antagonists stumbling into retreat, piling them in a jumble, making the whole group wish they had been assigned kitchen duty that night.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705804\" id=\"p_z8EbS\">Just a few days earlier, when He had entered the city triumphantly, \u201call the city was moved,\u201d the scripture says, asking, \u201cWho is this?\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"3\"><\/sup><\/a> I can only imagine that \u201cWho is this?\u201d is the question those muddled soldiers were now asking!<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705810\" id=\"p_z73jO\">The <em>answer<\/em> to that question could not have been in His looks, for Isaiah had prophesied some seven centuries earlier that \u201che hath no form nor comeliness; and when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"4\"><\/sup><\/a> It certainly wasn\u2019t in His polished wardrobe or His great personal wealth, of which He had neither. It could not be from any professional training in the local synagogues because we have no evidence that He ever studied at any of them, though even in His youth He could confound superbly prepared scribes and lawyers, astonishing them with His doctrine \u201cas one having authority.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"5\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705817\" id=\"p_yOeDM\">From that teaching in the temple to His triumphant entry into Jerusalem and this final, unjustifiable arrest, Jesus was routinely placed in difficult, often devious situations in which He was always triumphant\u2014victories for which we have no explanation except divine DNA.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705825\" id=\"p_mEzil\">Yet down through history many have simplified, even trivialized our image of Him and His witness of who He was. They have reduced His righteousness to mere prudishness, His justice to mere anger, His mercy to mere permissiveness. We must not be guilty of such simplistic versions of Him that conveniently ignore teachings we find uncomfortable. This \u201cdumbing down\u201d has been true even regarding His ultimate defining virtue, His love.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705833\" id=\"p_byTzJ\">During His mortal mission, Jesus taught that there were two great commandments. They have been taught in this conference and will forever be taught: \u201cLove the Lord thy God [and] love thy neighbour as thyself.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"6\"><\/sup><\/a> If we are to follow the Savior faithfully in these two crucial and inextricably linked rules, we ought to hold firmly to what He <em>actually<\/em> said. And what He <em>actually<\/em> said was, \u201cIf ye love me, keep my commandments.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"7\"><\/sup><\/a> On that same evening, He said we were to \u201clove one another; as I have loved you.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"8\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705842\" id=\"p_pq3yu\">In those scriptures, those qualifying phrases defining true, Christlike love\u2014sometimes referred to as charity\u2014are absolutely essential.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705851\" id=\"p_a4PhH\">What do they define? How did Jesus love?<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705856\" id=\"p_ecLvW\">First, He loved with \u201call [of His] heart, might, mind and strength,\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"9\"><\/sup><\/a> giving Him the ability to heal the deepest pain and declare the hardest reality. In short, He is one who could administer grace and insist on truth at the same time.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"10\"><\/sup><\/a> As Lehi said in his blessing to his son Jacob, \u201cRedemption cometh in and through the Holy Messiah; for he is full of grace and truth.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"11\"><\/sup><\/a> His love allows an encouraging embrace when it is needed and a bitter cup when it has to be swallowed. So we try to love\u2014with all of our heart, might, mind, and strength\u2014because that is the way He loves us.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705865\" id=\"p_lG92X\">The second characteristic of Jesus\u2019s divine charity was His obedience to <em>every word<\/em> that proceeded from God\u2019s mouth,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"12\"><\/sup><\/a> always aligning His will and behavior with that of His Heavenly Father.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"13\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705873\" id=\"p_wTovq\">When He arrived on the Western Hemisphere following His Resurrection, Christ said to the Nephites: \u201cBehold, I am Jesus Christ. \u2026 I have drunk out of that bitter cup which the Father hath given me, \u2026 in the which I have suffered the will of the Father \u2026 from the beginning.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note14\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"14\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705881\" id=\"p_kqFhj\">Of the myriad ways He could have introduced Himself, Jesus did so <em>by declaring His obedience to the will of the Father<\/em>\u2014never mind that not long before in His hour of greatest need, this Only Begotten Son of God had felt totally abandoned by His Father.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note15\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"15\"><\/sup><\/a> Christ\u2019s charity\u2014<em>evident in complete loyalty to divine will<\/em>\u2014persisted and continues to persist, not just through the easy and comfortable days but especially through the darkest and most difficult ones.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705890\" id=\"p_tRAfv\">Jesus was \u201ca man of sorrows,\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note16\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"16\"><\/sup><\/a> the scriptures say. He experienced sadness, fatigue, disappointment, and excruciating loneliness. In these and in all times, Jesus\u2019s love faileth not, and neither does His Father\u2019s. With such mature love\u2014the kind that exemplifies, empowers, and imparts\u2014ours will not fail either.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705897\" id=\"p_tlHKq\">So, if sometimes the harder you try, the more difficult it seems to get; if, just as you try to work on your limitations and your shortcomings, you find someone or something determined to challenge your faith; if, as you labor devotedly, you still feel moments of fear wash over you, remember that it has been so for some of the most faithful and marvelous people in every era of time. Also remember that there is a force in the universe determined to oppose <em>every good thing<\/em> you try to do.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note17\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"17\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705904\" id=\"p_xrDhi\">So, through abundance as well as poverty, through private acclaim as well as public criticism, through the divine elements of the Restoration as well as the human foibles that will inevitably be part of it, <em>we stay the course with<\/em> the true Church of Christ. Why? Because as with our Redeemer, we signed on for the whole term\u2014not ending with the first short introductory quiz but through to the final exam. The joy in this is that the Headmaster gave us all open-book answers <em>before the course began<\/em>. Furthermore, we have a host of tutors who remind us of these answers at regular stops along the way. But of course, none of this works if we keep cutting class.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705912\" id=\"p_hfMFc\">\u201cWhom seek ye?\u201d With all our hearts we answer, \u201cJesus of Nazareth.\u201d When He says, \u201cI am he,\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note18\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"18\"><\/sup><\/a> we bow our knee and confess with our tongue that He is the living Christ, that He alone atoned for our sins, that He was carrying us even when we thought He had abandoned us. When we stand before Him and see the wounds in His hands and feet, we will begin to comprehend what it meant for Him <em>to bear our sins and be acquainted with grief, to be completely obedient to the will of His Father<\/em>\u2014all out of pure love for us. To introduce others to faith, repentance, baptism, the gift of the Holy Ghost, and receiving our blessings in the house of the Lord\u2014these are the fundamental \u201cprinciples and ordinances\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note19\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"19\"><\/sup><\/a> that ultimately reveal our love of God and neighbor and joyfully characterize the true Church of Christ.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"162705919\" id=\"p_kDBdF\">Brothers and sisters, I testify that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the vehicle God has provided for our exaltation.
