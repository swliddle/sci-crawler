Do our baptismal, priesthood, and temple covenants mean more to us than the praise of the world or the number of \u201clikes\u201d on social media? Is our love for the Lord and His commandments stronger than our love for anything or anyone else in this life?<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808548\" id=\"p3\">The adversary and his followers have always sought to destroy the works of Christ and His prophets. The Savior\u2019s commandments, if not ignored altogether, have been rationalized into meaninglessness by many in today\u2019s world. Messengers of God who teach \u201cinconvenient\u201d truths are often dismissed. Even the Savior Himself was called \u201ca man gluttonous, and a winebibber,\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\">6<\/sup><\/a> accused of disturbing public sentiment and being divisive. Weak and conniving souls \u201ctook counsel how they might entangle him in his talk,\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\">7<\/sup><\/a> and His \u201csect\u201d of early Christians was \u201cevery where \u2026 spoken against.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\">8<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808560\" id=\"p4\">The Savior and His early followers dealt with serious internal and external opposition, and we experience the same. Today it is almost impossible to courageously live our faith without occasionally attracting a few actual and virtual fingers of scorn from the worldly. Confidently following the Savior is rewarding, but at times we may get caught in the crosshairs of those advocating an \u201ceat, drink, and be merry\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\">9<\/sup><\/a> philosophy, where faith in Christ, obedience, and repentance are substituted by the illusion that God will justify a little sin because He loves us so much.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808572\" id=\"p5\">Speaking \u201cby [His] own voice or by the voice of [His] servants,\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\">10<\/sup><\/a> did the Savior not say about our day that \u201cthe time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers\u201d and that many \u201cshall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables\u201d?<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\">11<\/sup><\/a> Did He not lament that \u201cin vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the commandments of men\u201d?<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\">12<\/sup><\/a> Did He not warn that \u201cof your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them\u201d?<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\">13<\/sup><\/a> Did He not foresee that \u201cevil [would be called] good, and good evil\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note14\"><sup class=\"marker\">14<\/sup><\/a> and that \u201ca man\u2019s foes shall be they of his own household\u201d?<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note15\"><sup class=\"marker\">15<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808584\" id=\"p6\">So what about us? Should we be intimidated or afraid? Should we live our religion at periscope depth? Surely not! With faith in Christ, we need not fear the reproach of men or be afraid of their revilings.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note16\"><sup class=\"marker\">16<\/sup><\/a> With the Savior at the helm and living prophets to lead and guide us, \u201cwho can be against us?\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note17\"><sup class=\"marker\">17<\/sup><\/a> Let us be confident, not apologetic, valiant, not timid, faithful, not fearful as we hold up the Lord\u2019s light in these last days.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note18\"><sup class=\"marker\">18<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808596\" id=\"p7\">The Savior made clear that \u201cwhosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I confess also before my Father. \u2026 But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny before my Father.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note19\"><sup class=\"marker\">19<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808608\" id=\"p8\">Consequently, while some would prefer a God who comes without commandments, let us boldly testify, in the words of Elder D. Todd Christofferson, that \u201ca God who makes no demands is the functional equivalent of a God who does not exist.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note20\"><sup class=\"marker\">20<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808621\" id=\"p9\">While some would prefer to be selective in the commandments they follow, let us joyfully accept the Savior\u2019s invitation to \u201clive by <em>every<\/em> word which proceedeth forth out of the mouth of God.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note21\"><sup class=\"marker\">21<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808633\" id=\"p10\">While many believe the Lord and His Church condone doing \u201cwhatsoever [our] heart desireth,\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note22\"><sup class=\"marker\">22<\/sup><\/a> let us valiantly proclaim that it is wrong to \u201cfollow a multitude to do evil,\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note23\"><sup class=\"marker\">23<\/sup><\/a> because \u201ccrowds cannot make right what God has declared to be wrong.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note24\"><sup class=\"marker\">24<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808645\" id=\"p11\">\u201cO remember, remember \u2026 how strict [yet liberating] are the commandments of God.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note25\"><sup class=\"marker\">25<\/sup><\/a> Teaching them clearly may at times be seen as an act of intolerance.
