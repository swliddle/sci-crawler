Widow's Mite\"/>\n<p data-aid=\"149807950\" id=\"p2\">And yet this seemingly inconsequential donation caught the Savior\u2019s attention. In fact, it impressed Him so deeply that \u201che called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them, Verily I say unto you, That this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the treasury:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149807957\" id=\"p3\">\u201cFor all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in all that she had, even all her living.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\">1<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149807964\" id=\"p4\">With this simple observation, the Savior taught us how offerings are measured in His kingdom\u2014and it\u2019s quite different from the way we usually measure things. To the Lord, the value of the donation was measured not by the effect it had on the treasury but by the effect it had on the heart of the donor.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149807971\" id=\"p5\">In praising this faithful widow, the Savior gave us a standard to measure our discipleship in all of its many expressions. Jesus taught that our offering may be large or it may be small, but either way, it must be our <em>heartfelt all<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149807977\" id=\"p6\">This principle is echoed in the plea of the Book of Mormon prophet Amaleki: \u201cCome unto Christ, who is the Holy One of Israel, and partake of his salvation, and the power of his redemption. Yea, come unto him, and offer your whole souls as an offering unto him.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\">2<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149807982\" id=\"p7\">But how is this possible? To many of us, such a standard of whole-souled commitment seems out of reach. We are already stretched so thin. How can we balance the many demands of life with our desires to offer our whole souls to the Lord?<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149807987\" id=\"p8\">Perhaps our challenge is that we think balance means dividing our time evenly among competing interests. Viewed in this way, our commitment to Jesus Christ would be one of many things we need to fit into our busy schedules. But perhaps there is another way to look at it.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"149807992\" id=\"title3\">Balance: Like Riding a Bicycle<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"149807997\" id=\"p9\">My wife, Harriet, and I love to go bicycle riding together. It\u2019s a wonderful way to get some exercise while also spending time together. While we\u2019re riding, and I\u2019m not huffing and puffing too much, we enjoy the beautiful world around us and even engage in a pleasant conversation. Rarely do we have to pay much attention to keeping our balance on our bicycles. We\u2019ve been riding long enough that we don\u2019t even think about that\u2014it has become normal and natural for us.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808002\" id=\"p10\">But whenever I watch someone learning to ride a bike for the first time, I\u2019m reminded that it\u2019s not easy balancing yourself on those two narrow wheels. It takes time. It takes practice. It takes patience. It even takes falling down a time or two.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808007\" id=\"p11\">Most of all, those who succeed in balancing on a bicycle learn these important tips:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808014\" id=\"p12\">Don\u2019t look at your feet.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808019\" id=\"p13\">Look ahead.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808024\" id=\"p14\">Keep your eyes on the road in front of you. Focus on your destination. And get pedaling. Staying balanced is all about moving forward.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808029\" id=\"p15\">Similar principles apply when it comes to finding balance in our lives as disciples of Jesus Christ. How to distribute your time and energy among your many important tasks will vary from person to person and from one season of life to another. But our common, overall objective is to follow the Way of our Master, Jesus Christ, and return to the presence of our beloved Father in Heaven. This objective must remain constant and consistent, whoever we are and whatever else is happening in our lives.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\">3<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"149808034\" id=\"title4\">Lift: Like Flying an Airplane<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"149808039\" id=\"p16\">Now, for those who are avid bicyclists, comparing discipleship to riding a bike may be a helpful analogy. For those who are not, don\u2019t worry. I have another analogy I\u2019m sure every man, woman, and child will be able to relate to.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808044\" id=\"p17\">Discipleship, like most things in life, can also be compared to flying an airplane.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808049\" id=\"p18\">Have you ever stopped to think how amazing it is that a huge passenger jet can actually get off the ground and fly? What is it that keeps these flying machines soaring elegantly through the sky, crossing oceans and continents?<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808054\" id=\"p19\">Put simply, an aircraft flies only when air is moving over its wings. That movement creates differences in air pressure that give the plane lift. And how do you get enough air moving over the wings to create lift? The answer is forward thrust.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808059\" id=\"p20\">The airplane gains no altitude sitting on the runway. Even on a windy day, enough lift isn\u2019t created unless the airplane is moving forward, with enough thrust to counteract the forces holding it back.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808064\" id=\"p21\">Just as forward momentum keeps a bicycle balanced and upright, moving forward helps an aircraft overcome the pull of gravity and drag.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808068\" id=\"p22\">What does this mean for us as disciples of Jesus Christ? It means that if we want to find balance in life, and if we want the Savior to lift us heavenward, then our commitment to Him and His gospel can\u2019t be casual or occasional. Like the widow at Jerusalem, we must offer Him our whole souls. Our offering may be small, but it must come from our heart and soul.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808072\" id=\"p23\">Being a disciple of Jesus Christ is not just one of many things we do. The Savior is the motivating power behind <em>all<\/em> that we do. He is not a rest stop in our journey. He is not a scenic byway or even a major landmark.
