Because we know that God has power to prevent or remove any affliction, we may be tempted to complain if He does not do it, perhaps questioning, \u201cIf God does not grant the help I pray for, how can I have faith in Him?\u201d At one point in his intense trials, righteous Job said: <\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808355\" id=\"p23\">\u201cThen know that God has wronged me and drawn his net around me. <\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808365\" id=\"p24\">\u201cThough I cry, \u2018I\u2019ve been wronged!\u2019 I get no response; though I call for help, there is no justice.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\">1<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808375\" id=\"p2\">In His response to Job, God demands, \u201cWilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous?\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\">2<\/sup><\/a> Or in other words, \u201cWill you even put me in the wrong? Will you condemn me that you may be justified?\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\">3<\/sup><\/a> Jehovah forcefully reminds Job of His omnipotence and omniscience, and Job in deepest humility admits he possesses nothing even close to the knowledge, power, and righteousness of God and cannot stand in judgment of the Almighty:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808385\" id=\"p32\">\u201cI know that thou canst do every thing,\u201d he said, \u201cand that no thought can be withholden from thee.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808395\" id=\"p33\">\u201c\u2026 I uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for me, which I knew not. \u2026<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808405\" id=\"p34\">\u201cWherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\">4<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808415\" id=\"p35\">In the end, Job was privileged to see the Lord, and \u201cthe Lord blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\">5<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808426\" id=\"p3\">It truly is folly for us with our mortal myopia to presume to judge God, to think, for example, \u201cI\u2019m not happy, so God must be doing something wrong.\u201d To us, His mortal children in a fallen world, who know so little of past, present, and future, He declares, \u201cAll things are present with me, for I know them all.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\">6<\/sup><\/a> Jacob wisely cautions: \u201cSeek not to counsel the Lord, but to take counsel from his hand. For behold, ye yourselves know that he counseleth in wisdom, and in justice, and in great mercy, over all his works.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\">7<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808437\" id=\"p4\">Some misunderstand the promises of God to mean that obedience to Him yields specific outcomes on a fixed schedule. They might think, \u201cIf I diligently serve a full-time mission, God will bless me with a happy marriage and children\u201d or \u201cIf I refrain from doing schoolwork on the Sabbath, God will bless me with good grades\u201d or \u201cIf I pay tithing, God will bless me with that job I\u2019ve been wanting.\u201d If life doesn\u2019t fall out precisely this way or according to an expected timetable, they may feel betrayed by God. But things are not so mechanical in the divine economy. We ought not to think of God\u2019s plan as a cosmic vending machine where we (1) select a desired blessing, (2) insert the required sum of good works, and (3) the order is promptly delivered.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\">8<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808448\" id=\"p5\">God will indeed honor His covenants and promises to each of us. We need not worry about that.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\">9<\/sup><\/a> The atoning power of Jesus Christ\u2014who descended below all things and then ascended on high<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\">10<\/sup><\/a> and who possesses all power in heaven and in earth<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\">11<\/sup><\/a>\u2014ensures that God can and will fulfill His promises. It is essential that we honor and obey His laws, but not every blessing predicated on obedience to law<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\">12<\/sup><\/a> is shaped, designed, and timed according to our expectations. We do our best but must leave to Him the management of blessings, both temporal and spiritual.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808459\" id=\"p6\">President Brigham Young explained that his faith was not built on certain outcomes or blessings but on his witness of and relationship with Jesus Christ. He said: \u201cMy faith is not placed upon the Lord\u2019s working upon the islands of the sea, upon his bringing the people here, \u2026 nor upon the favors he bestows upon this people or upon that people, neither upon whether we are blessed or not blessed, but <em>my faith is placed upon the Lord Jesus Christ, and my knowledge I have received from him<\/em>.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\">13<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808471\" id=\"p39\">Our repentance and obedience, our service and sacrifices do matter. We want to be among those described by Ether as \u201calways abounding in good works.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note14\"><sup class=\"marker\">14<\/sup><\/a> But it is not so much because of some tally kept in celestial account books. These things matter because they engage us in God\u2019s work and are the means by which we collaborate with Him in our own transformation from natural man to saint.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note15\"><sup class=\"marker\">15<\/sup><\/a> What our Heavenly Father offers us is Himself and His Son, a close and enduring relationship with Them through the grace and mediation of Jesus Christ, our Redeemer.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808483\" id=\"p36\">We are God\u2019s children, set apart for immortality and eternal life. Our destiny is to be His heirs, \u201cjoint-heirs with Christ.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note16\"><sup class=\"marker\">16<\/sup><\/a> Our Father is willing to guide each of us along His covenant path with steps designed to our individual need and tailored to His plan for our ultimate happiness with Him. We can anticipate a growing trust and faith in the Father and the Son, an increasing sense of Their love, and the consistent comfort and guidance of the Holy Spirit.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808495\" id=\"p8\">Even so, this path cannot be easy for any of us. There is too much refining needed for it to be easy. Jesus said: <\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808507\" id=\"p25\">\u201cI am the true vine, and my Father is the husbandman. <\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808519\" id=\"p26\">\u201cEvery branch in me that beareth not fruit [the Father] taketh away: and every branch that beareth fruit, he purgeth it, that it may bring forth more fruit.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note17\"><sup class=\"marker\">17<\/sup><\/a> <\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808531\" id=\"p27\">The process of God-directed purging and purifying will, of necessity, be wrenching and painful at times. Recalling Paul\u2019s expression, we are \u201cjoint-heirs with Christ; <em>if so be that we suffer with him<\/em>, that we may be also glorified together.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note18\"><sup class=\"marker\">18<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808543\" id=\"p9\">So, in the midst of this refiner\u2019s fire, rather than get angry with God, get close to God.

Gradually, he rose to prominence in his master\u2019s house in Egypt but then had all this progress ripped away because of the false accusations of Potiphar\u2019s wife. Joseph could have thought, \u201cSo prison is what I get for keeping the law of chastity.\u201d Instead he continued to turn to God and was prospered even in prison. Joseph suffered a further crushing disappointment when the prisoner he befriended, despite his promise to help Joseph, forgot all about him after being restored to his position in Pharaoh\u2019s court. In due course, as you know, the Lord intervened to put Joseph in the highest position of trust and power next to Pharaoh, enabling Joseph to save the house of Israel.
