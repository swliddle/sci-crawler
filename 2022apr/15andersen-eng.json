We love Him and we trust Him, and we pray that we will forever follow Him.<\/p>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"149807208\" id=\"title2\">The Challenge of Social Media<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"149807212\" id=\"p2\">The powerful impact of the internet is a blessing and a challenge, unique to our time.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149807214\" id=\"p3\">In a world of social media and information superhighways, one person\u2019s voice can be multiplied exponentially. That voice, whether true or false, whether fair or prejudicial, whether kind or cruel, moves instantly across the world.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149807217\" id=\"p4\">Social media posts of thoughtfulness and goodness are often quietly under the radar, while words of contempt and anger are frequently thundering in our ears, whether with political philosophy, people in the news, or opinions on the pandemic. No one or no subject, including the Savior and His restored gospel, is immune from this social phenomenon of polarized voices.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"149807219\" id=\"title3\">Becoming a Peacemaker<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"149807222\" id=\"p5\">The Sermon on the Mount is a message for all but was specifically given to the Savior\u2019s disciples, those who had chosen to follow Him.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149807225\" id=\"p6\">The Lord taught how to live, then and now, in a contemptuous world. \u201cBlessed are the peacemakers,\u201d He declared, \u201cfor they shall be called the children of God.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\">1<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149807227\" id=\"p7\">By the shield of our faith in Jesus Christ, we become peacemakers, quenching\u2014meaning to calm, cool, or extinguish\u2014all the fiery darts of the adversary.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\">2<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149807230\" id=\"p8\">As we do our part, His promise is that we will be called the \u201cchildren of God.\u201d Every person on earth is the \u201coffspring\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\">3<\/sup><\/a> of God, but to be called the \u201cchildren of God\u201d means much, much more. As we come unto Jesus Christ and make covenants with Him, we become \u201chis seed\u201d and \u201cheirs of the kingdom,\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\">4<\/sup><\/a> \u201cchildren of Christ, his sons, and his daughters.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\">5<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149807233\" id=\"p9\">How does a peacemaker calm and cool the fiery darts? Certainly not by shrinking before those who disparage us.

Brown, a national civil rights leader and pastor of the Third Baptist Church in San Francisco, responded:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149807239\" id=\"p44\">\u201cI respect the experience and perspective of the individual who wrote those words. Granted, I don\u2019t see what he sees.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149807242\" id=\"p45\">\u201cI count it one of my life\u2019s greatest joys to know these leaders [of the Church], including President Russell M. Nelson.
