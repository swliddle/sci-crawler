It has only one opening. At the end of the day, the shepherd calls the sheep. They know his voice, and through the gate they enter the safety of the fold. <\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149807974\" id=\"p6\">The people of Alma would have known that shepherds stand at the narrow opening of the fold so that when the sheep enter, they are numbered<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\">6<\/sup><\/a> and their wounds and ailments noted and cared for one by one. The safety and well-being of the sheep depend on their willingness to come into the fold and to stay in the fold.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149807979\" id=\"p7\">Among us there may be some who feel they are at the edge of the flock, perhaps thinking they are less needed or valued or that they don\u2019t belong in the fold. And, as in the sheepfold, in the fold of God we sometimes step on one another\u2019s toes and need to repent or forgive. <\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149807984\" id=\"p8\">But the Good Shepherd<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\">7<\/sup><\/a>\u2014our true shepherd\u2014is always good. Within the fold of God, we experience His watchful, nurturing care and are blessed to feel His redeeming love. He said, \u201cI have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy walls are continually before me.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\">8<\/sup><\/a> Our Savior has graven upon His palms our sins, pains, afflictions,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\">9<\/sup><\/a> and all that is unfair in life.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\">10<\/sup><\/a> All are welcome to receive these blessings, as they \u201care desirous to come\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\">11<\/sup><\/a> and choose to be in the fold. The gift of agency is not simply the right to choose; it is the opportunity to choose the right.

Here\u2019s why: <\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808028\" id=\"p12\">First: To <em>redeem<\/em> means to pay off a debt or obligation or to free from what distresses or harms.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note19\"><sup class=\"marker\">19<\/sup><\/a> No amount of personal improvement on our part can make us clean from the sins we have committed or whole from the wounds we have suffered without the Atonement of Jesus Christ. He is our Redeemer.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note20\"><sup class=\"marker\">20<\/sup><\/a> <\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808033\" id=\"p13\">Second: Because of Christ\u2019s Resurrection, all will be resurrected.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note21\"><sup class=\"marker\">21<\/sup><\/a> After our spirits depart our mortal bodies, we will undoubtedly look forward to when we can again with a resurrected body embrace those we love. We will eagerly look forward to being among those of the First Resurrection.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808038\" id=\"p14\">Third: Eternal life means to live with God and as He lives. It is \u201cthe greatest of all the gifts of God\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note22\"><sup class=\"marker\">22<\/sup><\/a> and will bring a fulness of joy.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note23\"><sup class=\"marker\">23<\/sup><\/a> It is the ultimate purpose and objective of our lives.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808043\" id=\"p15\">Fourth: The companionship of a member of the Godhead, the Holy Ghost, provides much-needed guidance and comfort during this mortal life.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note24\"><sup class=\"marker\">24<\/sup><\/a> <\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808048\" id=\"p16\">Consider some causes of unhappiness: misery comes from sin,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note25\"><sup class=\"marker\">25<\/sup><\/a> sadness and loneliness from the death of a loved one, and fear from the uncertainty of what happens when we die. But when we enter the fold of God and keep our covenants with Him, we feel the peace of knowing and trusting that Christ will redeem us from our sins, that the separation of our body and spirit will end more quickly, and that we will live eternally with God in a most glorious manner. <\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"149808053\" id=\"title4\">Trust in Christ and Act in Faith<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"149808058\" id=\"p17\">Brothers and sisters, the scriptures are filled with examples of the Savior\u2019s majestic power and His compassionate mercy and grace. During His earthly ministry, His blessings of healing came to those who trusted Him and acted in faith. For example, the infirm man at the pool of Bethesda walked when, with faith, he followed the Savior\u2019s command to \u201crise, take up thy bed, and walk.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note26\"><sup class=\"marker\">26<\/sup><\/a> Those who were sick or afflicted in any manner in the land of Bountiful were healed when \u201cwith one accord\u201d they \u201cdid go forth.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note27\"><sup class=\"marker\">27<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808063\" id=\"p18\">Similarly, to receive the marvelous blessings promised to those who come into the fold of God requires us to do just that\u2014we need to choose to come. Alma the Younger taught, \u201cAnd now I say unto you that the good shepherd doth call after you; and if you will hearken unto his voice he will bring you into his fold.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note28\"><sup class=\"marker\">28<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808067\" id=\"p19\">Several years ago a dear friend passed away from cancer. When his wife, Sharon, first wrote about his diagnosis, she said: \u201cWe Choose Faith. Faith in our Savior, Jesus Christ.
