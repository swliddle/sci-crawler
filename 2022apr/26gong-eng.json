As we discover our story, we connect, we belong, we become.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149805179\" id=\"p3\">My name is Gerrit Walter Gong. Gerrit is a Dutch name, Walter (my father\u2019s name) is an American name, and Gong of course is a Chinese name.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149805184\" id=\"p4\">Experts estimate some 70\u2013110 billion people have lived on the earth. Perhaps only one has been named Gerrit Walter Gong.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149805189\" id=\"p5\">We each have a story.

I believe \u201c[we] are, that [we] might have joy,\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\">2<\/sup><\/a> that there are times and seasons to everything under heaven.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\">3<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149805204\" id=\"p8\">Do you know your story? What your name means? World population grew from 1.1 billion people in 1820 to nearly 7.8 billion in 2020.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\">4<\/sup><\/a> The year 1820 seems to be an inflection point in history. Many born after 1820 have living memory and records to identify several family generations. Can you think of a special, sweet memory with a grandparent or other family member?<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149805210\" id=\"p9\">Whatever the total number of individuals who have lived on the earth, it is finite, countable, one person at a time. You and I, we each matter.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149805216\" id=\"p10\">And please consider this: whether or not we know them, we are each born of a mother and father. And each mother and father is born of a mother and father.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\">5<\/sup><\/a> By birth or adoptive lineage, we are ultimately all connected in the family of God and in the human family.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149805223\" id=\"p11\">Born AD 837, my 30th great-grandfather, First Dragon Gong, started our family village in southern China.

If you think your great-aunt has completed all your family genealogy, please find your cousins and cousins\u2019 cousins.

Globally, 25 percent of us trace our homeland to China, 23 percent to India, 17 percent to other parts of Asia and the Pacific, 18 percent to Europe, 10 percent to Africa, 7 percent to the Americas.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\">10<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149805251\" id=\"p15\">The question \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d also invites us to discover our divine identity and spiritual purpose in life.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808258\" id=\"p16\">We each have a story.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808265\" id=\"p17\">A family I know connected five family generations when they visited their old home in Winnipeg, Canada. There the grandfather told his grandsons about the day two missionaries (he called them angels from heaven) brought the restored gospel of Jesus Christ, changing their family forever.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808273\" id=\"p18\">A mother I know invited her children and their cousins to ask their great-grandmother about her childhood experiences. Great-Grandma\u2019s adventures and life lessons are now a treasured family book uniting generations.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808282\" id=\"p19\">A young man I know is compiling a \u201cDad journal.\u201d Years ago, a car hit and killed his father. Now, to know his father, this courageous young man is preserving childhood memories and stories from family and friends.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808291\" id=\"p20\">When asked where meaning comes in life, most people rank <em>family<\/em> first.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\">11<\/sup><\/a> This includes family living and gone before. Of course, when we die, we don\u2019t cease to exist. We continue to live on the other side of the veil.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808301\" id=\"p21\">Still very much alive, our ancestors deserve to be remembered.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\">12<\/sup><\/a> We remember our heritage through oral histories, clan records and family stories, memorials or places of remembrance, and celebrations with photos, foods, or items which remind us of loved ones.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808309\" id=\"p22\">Think of where you live\u2014isn\u2019t it wonderful how your country and community remember and honor ancestors, family, others who served and sacrificed? For example, at the autumn harvest remembrance in South Molton, Devonshire, England, Sister Gong and I loved finding the little church and community where generations of our Bawden family lived. We honor our ancestors by opening the heavens through temple and family history work<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\">13<\/sup><\/a> and by becoming a welding link<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note14\"><sup class=\"marker\">14<\/sup><\/a> in the chain of our generations.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note15\"><sup class=\"marker\">15<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808318\" id=\"p23\">In this age of \u201cI choose me,\u201d societies benefit when generations connect in meaningful ways. We need roots to have wings\u2014real relationships, meaningful service, life beyond fleeting social media veneers.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808327\" id=\"p24\">Connecting with our ancestors can change our lives in surprising ways. From their trials and accomplishments, we gain faith and strength.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note16\"><sup class=\"marker\">16<\/sup><\/a> From their love and sacrifices, we learn to forgive and move forward. Our children become resilient. We gain protection and power. Ties with ancestors increase family closeness, gratitude, miracles. Such ties can bring help from the other side of the veil.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808338\" id=\"p25\">Just as joys come in families, so can sorrows. No individual is perfect, nor is any family. When those who should love, nurture, and protect us fail to do so, we feel abandoned, embarrassed, hurt. Family can become a hollow shell. Yet, with heaven\u2019s help, we can come to understand our family and make peace with each other.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note17\"><sup class=\"marker\">17<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808348\" id=\"p26\">Sometimes unwavering commitment to abiding family relationships helps us accomplish hard things. In some cases, community becomes family. A remarkable young woman whose troubled family moved frequently found a loving Church family wherever she was to nurture and give her place. Genetics and family patterns influence but do not determine us.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808358\" id=\"p27\">God wants our families to be happy and forever. Forever is too long if we make each other unhappy. Happy is too short if cherished relationships stop with this life. Through sacred covenants, Jesus Christ offers His love, power, and grace to change us<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note18\"><sup class=\"marker\">18<\/sup><\/a> and heal our relationships. Selfless temple service for dear ones makes our Savior\u2019s Atonement real for them and us. Sanctified, we can return home to God\u2019s presence as families united eternally.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note19\"><sup class=\"marker\">19<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808368\" id=\"p28\">Each of our stories is a journey still in progress, as we discover, create, and become with possibilities beyond imagination.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808378\" id=\"p29\">The Prophet Joseph Smith said, \u201cIt may seem to some to be a very bold doctrine that we talk of\u2014a power which records or binds on earth and binds in heaven.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note20\"><sup class=\"marker\">20<\/sup><\/a> The sociality we create here can exist with eternal glory there.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note21\"><sup class=\"marker\">21<\/sup><\/a> Indeed, \u201cwe without [our family members] cannot be made perfect; neither can they without us be made perfect,\u201d that is, in \u201ca whole and complete and perfect union.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note22\"><sup class=\"marker\">22<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808388\" id=\"p30\">What can we do now?<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808398\" id=\"p31\">First, imagine your image reflected back and forth between two mirrors of eternity. In one direction, picture yourself as daughter, granddaughter, great-granddaughter; in the other direction, smile at yourself as aunt, mother, grandmother. How quickly time passes! In each time and role, notice who is with you. Gather their photos and stories; make their memories real. Record their names, experiences, key dates. They are your family\u2014the family you have and the family you want.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808408\" id=\"p32\">As you perform temple ordinances for family members, the spirit of Elijah, \u201ca manifestation of the Holy Ghost bearing witness of the divine nature of the family,\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note23\"><sup class=\"marker\">23<\/sup><\/a> will knit the hearts of your fathers, mothers, and children together in love.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note24\"><sup class=\"marker\">24<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808418\" id=\"p33\">Second, let the adventure of family history be intentional and spontaneous. Call your grandmother. Look deeply into the eyes of that new baby. Make time\u2014discover eternity\u2014at each stage of your journey. Learn and acknowledge with gratitude and honesty your family heritage. Celebrate and become the positive and, where needed, humbly do everything possible not to pass on the negative. Let good things begin with you.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808429\" id=\"p34\">Third, visit FamilySearch.org. Download the available mobile apps. They\u2019re free and fun. Discover, connect, belong. See how you are related to people in a room, how easy and rewarding it is to add names to your living family tree, to find and bless your roots and branches.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808440\" id=\"p35\">Fourth, help unite families eternally. Remember the demographics of heaven. There are many more on the other side of the veil than on this side. As more temples come closer to us, please offer those waiting for temple ordinances opportunity to receive them.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808451\" id=\"p36\">The promise at Easter and always is that, in and through Jesus Christ, we can become our best story and our families can become happy and forever. In all our generations, Jesus Christ heals the brokenhearted, delivers the captives, sets at liberty them that are bruised.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note25\"><sup class=\"marker\">25<\/sup><\/a> Covenant belonging with God and each other<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note26\"><sup class=\"marker\">26<\/sup><\/a> includes knowing our spirit and body will be reunited in resurrection and our most precious relationships can continue beyond death with a fulness of joy.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note27\"><sup class=\"marker\">27<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808462\" id=\"p37\">We each have a story. Come discover yours. Come find your voice, your song, your harmony in Him. This is the very purpose for which God created the heavens and the earth and saw that they were good.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note28\"><sup class=\"marker\">28<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149808474\" id=\"p38\">Praise God\u2019s plan of happiness, Jesus Christ\u2019s Atonement, continuing restoration in His gospel and Church. Please come find your family, all your generations, and bring them home. In the sacred and holy name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<footer class=\"notes\">\n<p class=\"title\" data-aid=\"149808486\" id=\"note_title1\">Notes<\/p>\n<ol class=\"decimal\" data-type=\"marker\" start=\"1\">\n<li data-marker=\"1.\" id=\"note1\" data-full-marker=\"1.\">\n<p data-aid=\"149808498\" id=\"note1_p1\">\u201cMy Heavenly Father Loves Me,\u201d <cite>Children\u2019s Songbook<\/cite>, 228.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"2.\" id=\"note2\" data-full-marker=\"2.\">\n<p data-aid=\"149808510\" id=\"note2_p1\"><a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.25?lang=eng#p25\">2 Nephi 2:25<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"3.\" id=\"note3\" data-full-marker=\"3.\">\n<p data-aid=\"149808522\" id=\"note3_p1\">See <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/ot/eccl/3.1?lang=eng#p1\">Ecclesiastes 3:1<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"4.\" id=\"note4\" data-full-marker=\"4.\">\n<p data-aid=\"149808534\" id=\"note4_p1\">Based on United Nations Secretariat, <cite>The World at Six Billion<\/cite> (1999), 5, table 1; \u201cWorld Population by Year,\u201d Worldometer, worldometers.info.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"5.\" id=\"note5\" data-full-marker=\"5.\">\n<p data-aid=\"149808546\" id=\"note5_p1\">Many are blessed to have parents who did not physically bear them, yet they are joined as family through bonds of affection and adoption and sacred sealing covenants.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"6.\" id=\"note6\" data-full-marker=\"6.\">\n<p data-aid=\"149808558\" id=\"note6_p1\">I express appreciation to those who are piloting ways to organize large numbers of family names into family trees.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"7.\" id=\"note7\" data-full-marker=\"7.\">\n<p data-aid=\"149808570\" id=\"note7_p1\">In 2021, some 99 million names were added to public family trees.

While Sarah was in St. Louis as a young teenager, her father, mother, and five siblings died. Henry and Sarah had 10 children. Sarah also raised six children of Henry\u2019s first wife, Ann Ireland, after she died. Sarah was also mother to two young granddaughters after her (Sarah\u2019s) daughter-in-law passed away. Despite life\u2019s many challenges, Sarah was warm, loving, compassionate, and of course very hardworking. She was affectionately known as \u201cLittle Grandma.\u201d<\/p>"
