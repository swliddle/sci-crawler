Nelson\u2019s powerful prophetic call to missionary service and President M. Russell Ballard\u2019s and Elder Marcos A. Aidukaitis\u2019s inspiring missionary messages today.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149807491\" id=\"p2\">A missionary assignment to Great Britain late last year allowed me to reflect on the precious spiritual events that were foundational to my decision to serve as a missionary.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\">1<\/sup><\/a> When I was 15 years old, my beloved older brother, Joe, was 20\u2014the age of eligibility then to serve a mission. In the United States, because of the Korean conflict, very few were allowed to serve. Only one could be called from each ward per year.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\">2<\/sup><\/a> It was a surprise when our bishop asked Joe to explore this possibility with our father. Joe had been preparing applications for medical school. Our father, who was not active in the Church, had made financial preparations to help him and was not in favor of Joe going on a mission. Dad suggested that Joe could do more good by going to medical school. This was a huge issue in our family.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149807498\" id=\"p3\">In a remarkable discussion with my wise and exemplary older brother, we concluded that his decision on whether to serve a mission and delay his education depended on three questions: (1) Is Jesus Christ divine? (2) Is the Book of Mormon the word of God? and (3) Is Joseph Smith the Prophet of the Restoration? If the answer to these questions was yes, it was clear that Joe could do more good taking the gospel of Jesus Christ to the world than becoming a doctor at an earlier date.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\">3<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149807507\" id=\"p4\">That night I prayed fervently and with real intent. The Spirit, in an undeniably powerful way, confirmed to me that the answer to all three of these questions was yes. This was a seminal event for me. I realized that every decision I would make for the rest of my life would be influenced by these truths. I also knew that I would serve a mission if given the opportunity. Over a lifetime of service and spiritual experiences, I have come to understand that true conversion is the result of the conscious acceptance of the will of God and that we can be guided in our actions by the Holy Ghost.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149807513\" id=\"p5\">I already had a testimony of the divinity of Jesus Christ as Savior of the world. That night I received a spiritual testimony of the Book of Mormon<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\">4<\/sup><\/a> and the Prophet Joseph Smith.<\/p>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"149807520\" id=\"title2\">Joseph Smith Was an Instrument in the Lord\u2019s Hands<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"149807527\" id=\"p6\">Your testimony will be strengthened when you know in your heart through your prayers that the Prophet Joseph Smith was an instrument in the Lord\u2019s hands. During the past eight years, one of my assignments in the Twelve Apostles was to review and read all the remarkable Joseph Smith papers and documents and the research that led to the publication of the <em>Saints<\/em> volumes.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\">5<\/sup><\/a> My testimony and admiration of the Prophet Joseph Smith have been greatly strengthened and enhanced after reading the inspiring details of his life and foreordained prophetic ministry.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149807535\" id=\"p7\">Joseph\u2019s translation of the Book of Mormon by the gift and power of God was foundational to the Restoration.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\">6<\/sup><\/a> The Book of Mormon is internally consistent, beautifully written, and contains the answers to life\u2019s great questions. It is another testament of Jesus Christ. I testify that Joseph Smith was righteous, full of faith, and an instrument in the Lord\u2019s hands in bringing forth the Book of Mormon.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149807544\" id=\"p8\">The revelations and events recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants provide the keys, ordinances, and covenants necessary for salvation and exaltation. They not only set forth the essentials required to establish the Church but also provide profound doctrine that allows us to understand the purpose of life and gives us an eternal perspective.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149807553\" id=\"p9\">One of the numerous examples of Joseph Smith\u2019s prophetic role is found in the <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76?lang=eng\">76th section of the Doctrine and Covenants<\/a>. It is an explicit record of the vision of heaven, including kingdoms of glory, which the Prophet Joseph and Sidney Rigdon were blessed to receive on February 16, 1832. At that time, the vast majority of churches were teaching that the Savior\u2019s Atonement would not provide salvation for most people. It was believed that a few would be saved and the vast majority would be doomed to hell and damnation, including endless tortures \u201cof the most awful and unspeakable intensity.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\">7<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149807562\" id=\"p10\">The revelation contained in the 76th section provides a glorious vision of the degrees of glory where the vast majority of Heavenly Father\u2019s children who were valiant in their premortal estate are profoundly blessed following the ultimate judgment.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\">8<\/sup><\/a> The vision of the three degrees of glory, the lowest of which \u201csurpasses all understanding,\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\">9<\/sup><\/a> is a direct refutation of the then strong but erroneous doctrine that the majority would be doomed to hell and damnation.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149807572\" id=\"p11\">When you realize Joseph Smith was only 26 years old, had a limited education, and had little or no exposure to the classical languages from which the Bible was translated, he was truly an instrument in the Lord\u2019s hands. In the <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/76.17?lang=eng#p17\">17th verse of section 76<\/a>, he was inspired to use the word <i>unjust<\/i> instead of <i>damnation<\/i> that was used in the Gospel of John.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\">10<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149807580\" id=\"p12\">It is interesting that 45 years later an Anglican church leader and academically credentialed classical scholar,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\">11<\/sup><\/a> Frederic W. Farrar, who wrote <cite>The Life of Christ<\/cite>,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\">12<\/sup><\/a> asserted that the definition of <em>damnation<\/em> in the King James Version of the Bible was the result of translation errors from Hebrew and Greek to English.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\">13<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149807589\" id=\"p13\">In our day, many have adopted the concept that there should be no consequence for sin. They support the unconditional condoning of sin without repentance. Our revealed doctrine not only refutes the idea that most people would be eternally condemned to hell and damnation but also establishes that personal repentance is a commanded prerequisite to partake of the Savior\u2019s Atonement and inherit the celestial kingdom.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note14\"><sup class=\"marker\">14<\/sup><\/a> I testify that Joseph Smith was truly an instrument in the Lord\u2019s hands in bringing forth the Restoration of His gospel!<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149807600\" id=\"p14\">Because of the Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ, we understand the importance of both repentance and the \u201cworks of righteousness.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note15\"><sup class=\"marker\">15<\/sup><\/a> We understand the overwhelming significance of the Savior\u2019s Atonement and of His saving ordinances and covenants, including those performed in the temple.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149807609\" id=\"p15\">The \u201cworks of righteousness\u201d emanate from and are the fruits of conversion. True conversion is brought about by the conscious acceptance and commitment to follow the will of God.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note16\"><sup class=\"marker\">16<\/sup><\/a> The banquet of consequences and blessings that flow from conversion is true and permanent peace and the personal assurance of ultimate happiness<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note17\"><sup class=\"marker\">17<\/sup><\/a>\u2014despite the storms of this life.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149807618\" id=\"p16\">Conversion to the Savior changes a natural man into a sanctified, born again, purified person\u2014a new creature in Christ Jesus.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note18\"><sup class=\"marker\">18<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"149807627\" id=\"title3\">Many Are Kept from the Truth Because They Know Not Where to Find It<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"149807636\" id=\"p17\">What are the obligations that flow from conversion? In Liberty Jail, the Prophet Joseph noted that many \u201care only kept from the truth because they know not where to find it.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note19\"><sup class=\"marker\">19<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149807644\" id=\"p18\">In the Lord\u2019s preface to the Doctrine and Covenants, a big-picture declaration of the Lord\u2019s purpose for us was set forth. He declared, \u201cWherefore, I the Lord, knowing the calamity which should come upon the inhabitants of the earth, called upon my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and spake unto him from heaven, and gave him commandments.\u201d He further instructs, \u201cThat the fulness of my gospel might be proclaimed by the weak and the simple unto the ends of the world.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note20\"><sup class=\"marker\">20<\/sup><\/a> That includes full-time missionaries.

As members of the Church, we cherish the Prophet Joseph\u2019s reply to John Wentworth, the editor of the <cite>Chicago Democrat<\/cite>, in 1842. He was requesting information about the Church. Joseph concluded his response by using the \u201cStandard of Truth\u201d as a preface to the thirteen Articles of Faith. The standard conveys, in a concise way, what must be accomplished:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149807686\" id=\"p23\">\u201cNo unhallowed hand can stop the work from progressing; persecutions may rage, mobs may combine, armies may assemble, calumny may defame, but the truth of God will go forth boldly, nobly, and independent, till it has penetrated every continent, visited every clime, swept every country, and sounded in every ear, till the purposes of God shall be accomplished, and the Great Jehovah shall say the work is done.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note27\"><sup class=\"marker\">27<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"149807694\" id=\"p24\">This has been the clarion call for generations of Latter-day Saints, especially missionaries.
