We were inspired as they expressed joy-filled gratitude for their newfound mobility.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"141537063\" id=\"p7\">A third precious moment occurred just a few weeks ago here in Salt Lake City. It came from a unique letter I received on my birthday from a young woman I will call Mary&#xFEFF;&#x2014;age 14.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"141537071\" id=\"p8\">Mary wrote about things she and I had in common: &#x201C;You have 10 kids. We have 10 kids. You speak Mandarin. Seven of the kids in my family, including me, were adopted from China, so Mandarin is our first language. You are a heart surgeon. My sister has had two open-heart [operations]. You like two-hour church. We like two-hour church. You have perfect pitch. My brother has perfect pitch too. He is blind like me.&#x201D;<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"141537081\" id=\"p9\">Mary&#x2019;s words touched me deeply, revealing not only her great spirit but also the consecration of her mother and father.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"141537088\" id=\"p10\">Latter-day Saints, as with other followers of Jesus Christ, are always looking for ways to help, to lift, and to love others. They who are willing to be called the Lord&#x2019;s people &#x201C;are willing to bear one another&#x2019;s burdens, &#x2026; to mourn with those that mourn; &#x2026; and [to] comfort those that stand in need of comfort.&#x201D;<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\">3<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"141537097\" id=\"p11\">They truly seek to live the first and second great commandments.

Pace were dispatched to Ethiopia to assess how those consecrated funds could best be used. This effort proved to be the beginning of what would later be known as Latter-day Saint Charities.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"141537128\" id=\"p15\">Since that time, Latter-day Saint Charities has provided more than <em>two billion<\/em> dollars in aid to assist those in need throughout the world. This assistance is offered to recipients regardless of their church affiliation, nationality, race, sexual orientation, gender, or political persuasion.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"141537136\" id=\"p16\">That is not all.

The Saints came to our meetings in great numbers. Though they had little in terms of material possessions, most came dressed in spotless white clothing.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"141537153\" id=\"p18\">I asked the stake president how he cared for members who had so little. He replied that their bishops knew their people well. If members could afford two meals a day, no help was needed. But if they could afford only one meal or less&#xFEFF;&#x2014;even with family help&#xFEFF;&#x2014;bishops provided food, financed from fast offerings. Then he added this remarkable fact: their fast-offering contributions usually <em>exceeded<\/em> their expenses. Surplus fast offerings were then sent to people <em>elsewhere<\/em> whose needs exceeded theirs. Those stalwart African Saints taught me a great lesson about the power of the <em>law<\/em> and the <em>spirit<\/em> of the fast.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"141537161\" id=\"p19\">As members of the Church, we feel a kinship to those who suffer in any way.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\">5<\/sup><\/a> As sons and daughters of God, we are all brothers and sisters.

In locations where no storehouse exists, bishops and branch presidents draw from fast-offering funds of the Church to provide food and supplies for their needy members.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"141537218\" id=\"p26\">However, the challenge of hunger goes far beyond the boundaries of the Church. It is increasing throughout the world.
