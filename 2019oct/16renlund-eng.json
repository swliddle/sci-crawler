They intentionally did not throw their objects into calm, shallow waters; they threw them into the churning waters of a massive waterfall, where the items became unrecoverable. These actions were a token of a new but unwavering commitment to Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"141533725\" id=\"p4\">People in other places and ages demonstrated their commitment to Jesus Christ in similar ways.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\">5<\/sup><\/a> The Book of Mormon people known as the Anti-Nephi-Lehies &#x201C;laid down the weapons of their rebellion,&#x201D; burying them &#x201C;deep in the earth&#x201D; as &#x201C;a testimony to God &#x2026; that they never would use [their] weapons again.&#x201D;<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\">6<\/sup><\/a> In doing so, they promised to follow God&#x2019;s teachings and never go back on their commitment. This action was the beginning of being &#x201C;converted unto the Lord&#x201D; and never falling away.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\">7<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"141533728\" id=\"p5\">Being &#x201C;converted unto the Lord&#x201D; means leaving one course of action, directed by an old belief system, and adopting a new one based on faith in Heavenly Father&#x2019;s plan and in Jesus Christ and His Atonement. This change is more than an intellectual acceptance of gospel teachings. It shapes our identity, transforms our understanding of life&#x2019;s meaning, and leads to unchanging fidelity to God. Personal desires that are contrary to being anchored to the Savior and to following the covenant path fade away and are replaced by a determination to submit to the will of Heavenly Father.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"141533732\" id=\"p6\">Being converted unto the Lord starts with an unwavering commitment to God, followed by making that commitment part of who we are. Internalizing such a commitment is a lifelong process that requires patience and ongoing repentance. Eventually, this commitment becomes part of who we are, embedded in our sense of self, and ever present in our lives. Just as we never forget our own name no matter what else we are thinking about, we never forget a commitment that is etched in our hearts.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\">8<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"141533736\" id=\"p7\">God invites us to cast our old ways completely out of reach and begin a new life in Christ. This happens as we develop faith in the Savior, which begins by hearing the testimony of those who have faith.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\">9<\/sup><\/a> Thereafter, faith deepens as we act in ways that anchor us more firmly to Him.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\">10<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"141533740\" id=\"p8\">Now, it would be nice if increased faith were transmitted like the flu or the common cold. Then a simple &#x201C;spiritual sneeze&#x201D; would build faith in others. But it does not work that way. The only way faith grows is for an individual to act in faith. These actions are often prompted by invitations extended by others, but we cannot &#x201C;grow&#x201D; someone else&#x2019;s faith or rely solely on others to bolster our own. For our faith to grow, we must choose faith-building actions, such as praying, studying the scriptures, partaking of the sacrament, keeping the commandments, and serving others.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"141533742\" id=\"p9\">As our faith in Jesus Christ grows, God invites us to make promises with Him. These covenants, as such promises are known, are manifestations of our conversion. Covenants also create a sure foundation for spiritual progression. As we choose to be baptized, we begin to take upon ourselves the name of Jesus Christ<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\">11<\/sup><\/a> and choose to identify ourselves with Him. We pledge to become like Him and to develop His attributes.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"141533745\" id=\"p23\">Covenants anchor us to the Savior and propel us along the path that leads to our heavenly home. The power of covenants helps us maintain the mighty change of heart, deepen our conversion to the Lord, and receive Christ&#x2019;s image more fully in our countenance.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\">12<\/sup><\/a> But a half-hearted commitment to our covenants will not guarantee us anything.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\">13<\/sup><\/a> We may be tempted to equivocate, throw our old ways in calm water, or bury our weapons of rebellion with the handles sticking out. But an ambivalent commitment to our covenants will not open the door to the sanctifying power of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n<img alt=\"Kinshasa Temple\" id=\"img3\" src=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/62/e3/62e331269caabd671ecd2689c8f4786d48d02d6d/kinshasa_democratic_republic_of_the_congo_temple.png\" data-img-id=\"2293591\" srcset=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/90/ef/90ef4c814a033c6b52fd461b1e4cc4ae322ca3b8/kinshasa_democratic_republic_of_the_congo_temple.png 60w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/40/f9/40f9497cee667d8f758681a909bc4794ab287400/kinshasa_democratic_republic_of_the_congo_temple.png 100w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/d7/5a/d75aef1a1224a349c6dea079b139162dd9e165a3/kinshasa_democratic_republic_of_the_congo_temple.png 200w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/84/b9/84b9d4a1435d942f18d1490993b5d9c35e160802/kinshasa_democratic_republic_of_the_congo_temple.png 250w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/91/51/915140a31306086f7284b15457e66ac0a3e782ae/kinshasa_democratic_republic_of_the_congo_temple.png 320w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/62/e3/62e331269caabd671ecd2689c8f4786d48d02d6d/kinshasa_democratic_republic_of_the_congo_temple.png 500w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/4f/a3/4fa3a55be25b85077005e05c78a4dcfb19930d72/kinshasa_democratic_republic_of_the_congo_temple.png 640w\" data-assetid=\"420441626ebf4b3be5065a7bb771b817f91fdb1e\" data-missing-asset=\"false\">\n<p data-aid=\"141533747\" id=\"p11\">Our commitment to keep our covenants should not be conditional or vary with changing circumstances in our lives.

They were highly respected in their Protestant church community. Because of their talents, their church arranged for their young family to go to Switzerland to study and provided a university scholarship.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"141535761\" id=\"p14\">While in Geneva, on the bus route to school, Brother Banza frequently saw a small meetinghouse with the name &#x201C;The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.&#x201D; He wondered, &#x201C;Does Jesus Christ have Saints now, in the latter days?&#x201D; He eventually decided to go and see.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"141535763\" id=\"p15\">Brother and Sister Banza were greeted warmly at the branch. They asked some of the persistent questions they had about the nature of God, such as, &#x201C;If God is a spirit, like the wind, how could we be created in His likeness? How could He sit on a throne?&#x201D; They had never received a satisfactory answer until the missionaries explained restored doctrine in a brief lesson. When the missionaries left, the Banzas looked at each other and said, &#x201C;Isn&#x2019;t this the truth that we have heard?&#x201D; They continued coming to church and meeting with the missionaries. They knew that baptism in the restored Church of Jesus Christ would have consequences. They would be stripped of their scholarships, their visas would be revoked, and they and their two young children would be required to leave Switzerland. They chose to be baptized and confirmed in October 1979.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"141535767\" id=\"p16\">Two weeks after their baptism, Brother and Sister Banza returned to Kinshasa as the first and second members of the Church in their country. The members of the Geneva Branch stayed in contact with them and helped them connect with Church leaders. The Banzas were encouraged to faithfully await the promised time when God would establish His Church in Zaire.<\/p>\n<img alt=\"Elder Mbuyi\" id=\"img5\" src=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/c6/5e/c65e2fb8d4655071fe40e2b74b4307cda1e0a386/dieudonne_mbuyi.png\" data-img-id=\"2293595\" srcset=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/41/6c/416c71c38784cfaf3219d74ff73778c33923f7d4/dieudonne_mbuyi.png 30w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/c0/95/c095fb7ffac00b6ab0e931ae1bc9e303612c2209/dieudonne_mbuyi.png 60w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/e6/45/e64507e058d0205e344933da498c44231542ad27/dieudonne_mbuyi.png 64w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/cb/92/cb92276c25f0c3852229886e62ce328c92fd52cd/dieudonne_mbuyi.png 100w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/6b/50/6b5023a84967a3583987f9343bd86a5816933027/dieudonne_mbuyi.png 200w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/b8/67/b8675eb2720e1847d5791ad0e639728b4710001d/dieudonne_mbuyi.png 205w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/65/97/6597b055dbeda55e5fc90bc06d7807c18fe7bb9d/dieudonne_mbuyi.png 250w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/02/e1/02e15b41e0f53af44bc7c4fcbdcb1aeb7dbaf094/dieudonne_mbuyi.png 320w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/c6/5e/c65e2fb8d4655071fe40e2b74b4307cda1e0a386/dieudonne_mbuyi.png 500w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/5a/eb/5aeb283feb0d4ccce4466158b887a01815225827/dieudonne_mbuyi.png 640w\" data-assetid=\"ba53d54e562b3e487fd453d2c3f5204bc7cd56d9\" data-missing-asset=\"false\">\n<p data-aid=\"141535771\" id=\"p17\">Meanwhile, another exchange student from Zaire, Brother Mbuyi, was studying in Belgium. He was baptized in 1980 in the Brussels Ward. Soon thereafter, he served a full-time mission to England. And God worked His miracles. Brother Mbuyi returned to Zaire as the third member of the Church in his country. With parental permission, Church meetings were held in his family home. In February 1986 a petition was made for official government recognition of the Church. The signatures of three citizens of Zaire were required. The three happy signatories of the petition were Brother Banza, Sister Banza, and Brother Mbuyi.<\/p>\n<img alt=\"Brother Mbuyi and the Banzas\" id=\"img6\" src=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/07/19/07193d71f7cb21a95e45ef24964507aec6a1f1f7/banza_family.jpeg\" data-img-id=\"2293597\" srcset=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/cb/37/cb37f11c9aa561645ae84000f7ad0f5f64551f91/banza_family.jpeg 60w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/f2/9a/f29a4d2ec5414bc9299f352de614edd0828820de/banza_family.jpeg 100w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/24/42/2442688a0ab04ab5ef90ee41a8e157e22c217719/banza_family.jpeg 200w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/9b/7c/9b7c0e705003ed96a576d68e36879bc8ee49d8ee/banza_family.jpeg 250w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/46/62/466209c5efff8c67903cb5dca29d311275dba690/banza_family.jpeg 320w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/07/19/07193d71f7cb21a95e45ef24964507aec6a1f1f7/banza_family.jpeg 500w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/77/82/7782c933f35f98b53439d1f27da3d4fb5f3a0b79/banza_family.jpeg 640w\" data-assetid=\"e6279d9d3d9fd686353eb9a02a881ddcf5d5f7fd\" data-missing-asset=\"false\">\n<p data-aid=\"141535775\" id=\"p18\">These stalwart members knew the truth when they heard it; they made a covenant at baptism that anchored them to the Savior. They metaphorically threw their old ways into a churning waterfall with no intention of retrieving them. The covenant path was never easy. Political turmoil, infrequent contact with Church leaders, and challenges inherent in building a community of Saints might have deterred less-committed individuals. But Brother and Sister Banza and Brother Mbuyi persevered in their faith. They were present at the dedication of the Kinshasa Temple, 33 years after they signed the petition that led to the official recognition of the Church in Zaire.<\/p>\n<img alt=\"Brother and Sister Banza\" id=\"img7\" src=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/f4/07/f4077930663f4c1586d386d7e6b0c16d56127c93/banza_family.jpeg\" data-img-id=\"2293599\" srcset=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/25/24/2524a0d94b1f4786253d5db3bb27054b4dbec63e/banza_family.jpeg 60w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/1b/3d/1b3d19e9f4694fdba437701c78a52ba3c4aefdf2/banza_family.jpeg 100w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/80/c6/80c68752cb1df47b0e3793f22d0b44b39ba4c41f/banza_family.jpeg 200w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/cf/31/cf3151d3607673fa2c3df7fc4131f9d73c2b0a0b/banza_family.jpeg 250w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/24/80/24802c02f4690a6fdee08cc4a568a570c782c9d6/banza_family.jpeg 320w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/f4/07/f4077930663f4c1586d386d7e6b0c16d56127c93/banza_family.jpeg 500w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/8b/8a/8b8a128b9ddc99b265f695be063eb794db76c810/banza_family.jpeg 640w\" data-assetid=\"b55edaa25cb9dccad3df79c3f78441694f6e9e8c\" data-missing-asset=\"false\">\n<p data-aid=\"141535779\" id=\"p24\">The Banzas are here in the Conference Center today.

In the mission leadership seminar in June 2019, after partaking of the sacrament, before beginning his formal message, President Russell&#xA0;M. Nelson said: &#x201C;A thought has occurred to me that my making a covenant today is a lot more important than the message that I have prepared. I made a covenant as I partook of the sacrament that I would be willing to take upon me the name of Jesus Christ and that I am willing to obey His commandments. Often, I hear the expression that we partake of the sacrament to renew covenants made at baptism. While that&#x2019;s true, it&#x2019;s much more than that. I&#x2019;ve made a new covenant. You have made new covenants. &#x2026; Now in return for which He makes the statement that we will always have His Spirit to be with us. What a blessing!&#x201D;<\/p>",
