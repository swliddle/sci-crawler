<p data-aid="141537360" id="p8">The adversary used the tool of deception in the days of Moses. The Lord declared to Moses:</p>
<p data-aid="141537365" id="p31">&#x201C;Behold, thou art my son. &#x2026;</p>
<p data-aid="141537367" id="p30">&#x201C;I have a work for thee, &#x2026; and thou art in the similitude of mine Only Begotten.&#x201D;<sup class="noteMarker">

The deception was not only in the invitation to worship Satan but also in the way he described Moses as a son of man. Remember, the Lord had just told Moses he was a son of God, created in the similitude of the Only Begotten.</p>
<p data-aid="141537371" id="p10">The adversary was relentless in his attempts to deceive Moses, but Moses resisted, saying, &#x201C;Depart from me, Satan, for this one God only will I worship, which is the God of glory.&#x201D;<sup class="noteMarker">

<p data-aid="141537383" id="p17">Lastly, the adversary desires for us to become discouraged. We may get discouraged when we compare ourselves to others or feel we are not living up to expectations, including our own.</p>
<p data-aid="141537385" id="p18">When I started my doctoral program, I felt discouraged. The program accepted only four students that year, and the other students were brilliant. They had higher test scores and more work experience at senior management positions, and they exuded confidence in their abilities.

<p data-aid="141537386" id="p19">I decided that if I were going to complete this four-year program, I would finish reading the Book of Mormon each semester.
