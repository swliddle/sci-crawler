While hunting alone in the forest, Enos began pondering on the teachings of his father, Jacob.

In the spiritual hunger of his soul, Enos knelt in prayer, a remarkable prayer that lasted through the day and into the night, a prayer that brought him crucial revelations, assurances, and promises.</p>
<p data-aid="141535514" id="p2">There is much to be learned from Enos&#x2019;s experience, but today what stands out in my mind is Enos&#x2019;s memory of his father speaking often of &#x201C;the joy of the saints.&#x201D;</p>

Not infrequently, people who flout divine directives such as the law of chastity, the standard of honesty, and the holiness of the Sabbath seem to prosper and enjoy the good things of life, at times even more so than those who are striving to be obedient. Some begin to wonder if the effort and sacrifices are worth it. The ancient people of Israel once complained:</p>
