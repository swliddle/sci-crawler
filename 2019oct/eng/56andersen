<p data-aid="141536460" id="p4">In a vivid dream that we all know well in the Book of Mormon, the prophet Lehi finds himself in &#x201C;a dark and dreary wilderness.&#x201D; There is filthy water, a mist of darkness, strange roads, and forbidden paths, as well as a rod of iron<sup class="noteMarker">
<a href="#note4">4</a>
<span class="footnote">[In early January 2007, while preparing for a Brigham Young University devotional address as a member of the Presidency of the Seventy to be given on March 4, 2007, I asked Elder David&#xA0;A. Bednar what he was preparing for his February 4, 2007, address before the same audience. I was taken aback when he responded that his talk was about holding fast to the iron rod. This was the exact title I had chosen for my talk. After sharing our text with one another, we realized that our approaches were different. His talk, entitled &#x201C;<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/david-a-bednar/reservoir-living-water/">A Reservoir of Living Water</a>,&#x201D; emphasized the rod of iron, or the word of God, as encompassing the scriptures. In his talk he asked, &#x201C;Are you and I daily reading, studying, and searching the scriptures in a way that enables us to hold fast to the rod of iron?&#x201D; (speeches.byu.edu).</p>
<p data-aid="141536614" id="note4_p2">Then, just a week after my conversation with Elder Bednar, President Boyd&#xA0;K. Packer gave a BYU devotional address entitled &#x201C;<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/boyd-k-packer/lehis-dream/">Lehi&#x2019;s Dream and You</a>.&#x201D; President Packer emphasized the rod of iron as the personal revelation and inspiration that come to us through the Holy Ghost. He said: &#x201C;If you hold to the rod, you can <em>feel</em>
your way forward with the gift of the Holy Ghost. &#x2026; Grasp the iron rod, and do not let go. Through the power of the Holy Ghost, you can <em>feel</em>
your way through life&#x201D; (Jan. 16, 2007, speeches.byu.edu).</p>
<p data-aid="141536616" id="note4_p3">My subject, &#x201C;<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/neil-l-andersen/hold-fast-words-prophets/">Hold Fast to the Words of the Prophets</a>,&#x201D; in March 2007 was the iron rod as representing the words of the living prophets (Mar. 4, 2007, speeches.byu.edu).</p>
<p data-aid="141536618" id="note4_p4">The connection of these three talks was no coincidence. The hand of the Lord was at work as three talks, prepared for the same audience, identified three aspects of the iron rod, or the word of God: (1)&#xA0;the scriptures, or the words of ancient prophets; (2)&#xA0;the words of living prophets; and (3)&#xA0;the power of the Holy Ghost. It was an important learning experience for me.]</span>

along a strait and narrow path leading to a beautiful tree with &#x201C;fruit [that makes] one happy.&#x201D; Recounting the dream, Lehi says: &#x201C;I did &#x2026; partake of the fruit; &#x2026; it was most sweet, above all that I [had] ever &#x2026; tasted. &#x2026; [And] it filled my soul with exceedingly great joy.&#x201D; <em>This</em>

As has been said many times in this conference, we continue to face distractions and deceptions, confusion and commotion, enticements and temptations that attempt to pull our hearts away from the Savior and the joys and beauties we have experienced in following Him.</p>
<p data-aid="141536496" id="p10">Because of this adversity, Lehi&#x2019;s dream also includes a warning! On the other side of the river is a spacious building with people of all ages pointing their fingers, mocking, and scoffing at the righteous followers of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p data-aid="141536499" id="p11">The people in the building are ridiculing and laughing at those keeping the commandments, hoping to discredit and deride their faith in Jesus Christ and in His gospel. And because of the verbal attacks of doubt and disdain launched at the believers, some of those who have tasted of the fruit begin to feel ashamed of the gospel they once embraced. The false allures of the world seduce them; they turn away from the tree and from the fruit and, in the words of the scripture, &#x201C;[fall] away into forbidden paths and [are] lost.&#x201D;<sup class="noteMarker">

He said: &#x201C;If you hold to the rod, you can <em>feel</em>
your way forward with the gift of the Holy Ghost. &#x2026; Grasp the iron rod, and do not let go. Through the power of the Holy Ghost, you can <em>feel</em>
your way through life&#x201D; (Jan. 16, 2007, speeches.byu.edu).</p>
<p data-aid="141536616" id="note4_p3">My subject, &#x201C;<a href="https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/neil-l-andersen/hold-fast-words-prophets/">Hold Fast to the Words of the Prophets</a>,&#x201D; in March 2007 was the iron rod as representing the words of the living prophets (Mar. 4, 2007, speeches.byu.edu).</p>
<p data-aid="141536618" id="note4_p4">The connection of these three talks was no coincidence. The hand of the Lord was at work as three talks, prepared for the same audience, identified three aspects of the iron rod, or the word of God: (1)&#xA0;the scriptures, or the words of ancient prophets; (2)&#xA0;the words of living prophets; and (3)&#xA0;the power of the Holy Ghost. It was an important learning experience for me.</p>
