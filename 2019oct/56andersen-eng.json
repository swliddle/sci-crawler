It represents &#x201C;the love of God&#x201D;<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\">6<\/sup><\/a> and proclaims our Heavenly Father&#x2019;s marvelous plan of redemption. &#x201C;For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.&#x201D;<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\">7<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"141536476\" id=\"p6\">This precious fruit symbolizes the wondrous blessings of the Savior&#x2019;s incomparable Atonement. Not only will we live again following our mortality, but through our faith in Jesus Christ, our repentance, and our keeping the commandments, we can be forgiven of our sins and one day stand clean and pure before our Father and His Son.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"141536480\" id=\"p7\">Partaking of the fruit of the tree also symbolizes that we embrace the ordinances and covenants of the restored gospel&#xFEFF;&#x2014;being baptized, receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost, and entering the house of the Lord to be endowed with power from on high. Through the grace of Jesus Christ and by honoring our covenants, we receive the immeasurable promise of living with our righteous family throughout eternity.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\">8<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"141536485\" id=\"p8\">No wonder the angel described the fruit as &#x201C;the most joyous to the soul.&#x201D;<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\">9<\/sup><\/a> It truly is!<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"141536489\" id=\"title6\">The Challenge of Staying True<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"141536493\" id=\"p9\">As we have all learned, even after savoring the precious fruit of the restored gospel, staying true and faithful to the Lord Jesus Christ is still not easily done. As has been said many times in this conference, we continue to face distractions and deceptions, confusion and commotion, enticements and temptations that attempt to pull our hearts away from the Savior and the joys and beauties we have experienced in following Him.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"141536496\" id=\"p10\">Because of this adversity, Lehi&#x2019;s dream also includes a warning! On the other side of the river is a spacious building with people of all ages pointing their fingers, mocking, and scoffing at the righteous followers of Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"141536499\" id=\"p11\">The people in the building are ridiculing and laughing at those keeping the commandments, hoping to discredit and deride their faith in Jesus Christ and in His gospel. And because of the verbal attacks of doubt and disdain launched at the believers, some of those who have tasted of the fruit begin to feel ashamed of the gospel they once embraced.

        "text": "<p data-aid=\"141536611\" id=\"note4_p1\">In early January 2007, while preparing for a Brigham Young University devotional address as a member of the Presidency of the Seventy to be given on March 4, 2007, I asked Elder David&#xA0;A. Bednar what he was preparing for his February 4, 2007, address before the same audience. I was taken aback when he responded that his talk was about holding fast to the iron rod. This was the exact title I had chosen for my talk. After sharing our text with one another, we realized that our approaches were different. His talk, entitled &#x201C;<a href=\"https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/david-a-bednar/reservoir-living-water/\">A Reservoir of Living Water<\/a>,&#x201D; emphasized the rod of iron, or the word of God, as encompassing the scriptures. In his talk he asked, &#x201C;Are you and I daily reading, studying, and searching the scriptures in a way that enables us to hold fast to the rod of iron?&#x201D; (speeches.byu.edu).<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"141536614\" id=\"note4_p2\">Then, just a week after my conversation with Elder Bednar, President Boyd&#xA0;K. Packer gave a BYU devotional address entitled &#x201C;<a href=\"https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/boyd-k-packer/lehis-dream/\">Lehi&#x2019;s Dream and You<\/a>.&#x201D; President Packer emphasized the rod of iron as the personal revelation and inspiration that come to us through the Holy Ghost. He said: &#x201C;If you hold to the rod, you can <em>feel<\/em> your way forward with the gift of the Holy Ghost. &#x2026; Grasp the iron rod, and do not let go. Through the power of the Holy Ghost, you can <em>feel<\/em> your way through life&#x201D; (Jan. 16, 2007, speeches.byu.edu).<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"141536616\" id=\"note4_p3\">My subject, &#x201C;<a href=\"https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/neil-l-andersen/hold-fast-words-prophets/\">Hold Fast to the Words of the Prophets<\/a>,&#x201D; in March 2007 was the iron rod as representing the words of the living prophets (Mar. 4, 2007, speeches.byu.edu).<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"141536618\" id=\"note4_p4\">The connection of these three talks was no coincidence. The hand of the Lord was at work as three talks, prepared for the same audience, identified three aspects of the iron rod, or the word of God: (1)&#xA0;the scriptures, or the words of ancient prophets; (2)&#xA0;the words of living prophets; and (3)&#xA0;the power of the Holy Ghost. It was an important learning experience for me.<\/p>",
