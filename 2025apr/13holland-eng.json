Holland<\/p>\n<p class=\"author-role\" data-aid=\"165187839\" id=\"p_t728c\">Acting President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"kicker\" data-aid=\"165187842\" id=\"p_nP39o\">I testify that babies and children and youth are images of the kingdom of God flourishing on earth in all of its strength and beauty.<\/p>\n<\/header>\n<div class=\"body-block\">\n<p data-aid=\"165187845\" id=\"p_jiZO5\">Jesus began the last year of His mortal life by intensifying the training of His Apostles. If His message and His Church were to survive Him, more had to be pressed into the hearts of 12 very ordinary men who had known Him for scarcely 24 months.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187849\" id=\"p_gGRuG\">One day Jesus witnessed an argument among the Twelve and later asked, \u201cWhat was it that ye disputed among yourselves?\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"1\"><\/sup><\/a> Apparently embarrassed, they \u201cheld their peace,\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"2\"><\/sup><\/a> the record says. But this greatest of all teachers perceived the thoughts of their hearts<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"3\"><\/sup><\/a> and sensed the first blush of personal pride. So He \u201ccalled a little child unto him, \u2026<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187853\" id=\"p_toZ2Q\">\u201cAnd said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187857\" id=\"p_ks7W9\">\u201cWhosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"4\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187861\" id=\"p_rt4qT\">It should be noted that even before Christ\u2019s birth, King Benjamin\u2019s farewell sermon included this profound comment on a child\u2019s humility. It says, \u201cThe natural man is an enemy to God, \u2026 and will be, forever and ever, unless he \u2026 becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord, and becometh as a child, submissive, \u2026 humble, \u2026 full of love, \u2026 even as a child [responds] to his father.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"5\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187864\" id=\"p_jCQR9\">Now, there are obviously some infantile inclinations we <em>don\u2019t<\/em> encourage. Twenty-five years ago, my then-three-year-old grandson bit his five-year-old sister on the arm. My son-in-law, caring for the children that night, frantically taught his daughter all the lessons on forgiveness he could think of, concluding that her little brother probably didn\u2019t even know what a bite on the arm felt like. That ill-conceived fatherly comment worked for about a minute, maybe a minute and a half, until there was a window-rattling cry from the children\u2019s bedroom, where my granddaughter calmly called out, \u201cHe does now.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187868\" id=\"p_yAFjT\">So what is it that we are to see in the virtues of life\u2019s junior varsity? What was it that brought Christ Himself to tears in the most tender scene in the entire Book of Mormon? What was Jesus teaching when He called down heavenly fire and protective angels to surround those children, commanding the adults to \u201cbehold [their] little ones\u201d?<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"6\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187872\" id=\"p_rQUL4\">We don\u2019t know what prompted all of that, but I have to think it had something to do with their purity and innocence, their inborn humility, and what it <em>could<\/em> bring to our lives if we retain it.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187876\" id=\"p_fIUMC\">Why are our days of despair labeled by one as \u201cvanity of vanities\u201d?<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"7\"><\/sup><\/a> How is it that \u201cvain imaginations and the pride of the children of men\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"8\"><\/sup><\/a> are the words that characterize the great and spacious building, so spiritually dead in Lehi\u2019s vision? And the Zoramites, that group who prayed so self-servingly? Of them Alma said, \u201cO God, they [pray] unto thee with their mouths, while they are puffed up \u2026 with the vain things of the world.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"9\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187880\" id=\"p_kw7NA\">By contrast, is there anything sweeter, more pure, or more humble than a child at prayer? It is as if heaven is in the room. God and Christ are so real, but for others later on, the experience can become more superficial.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187884\" id=\"p_lxm0S\">As Elder Richard L. Evans quoted some 60 years ago: \u201cMany of us profess to be Christians, yet we \u2026 do not take Him seriously. \u2026 We respect Him, but we don\u2019t follow Him. \u2026 We quote His sayings, but we don\u2019t live by them.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"10\"><\/sup><\/a> \u201cWe admire Him, but we don\u2019t worship Him.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"11\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187889\" id=\"p_kjrNI\">How different life could be if the world esteemed Jesus above the level of a profane swearing streak from time to time.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187894\" id=\"p_f2tDA\">But children really do love Him, and that love can carry over into their other relationships in the playground of life. As a rule, even in their youngest years, children love so easily, they forgive so readily, they laugh so delightfully that even the coldest, hardest heart can melt.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187898\" id=\"p_uEw0a\">Well, the list goes on and on. Purity? Trust? Courage? Character?<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187904\" id=\"p_x05B0\">Come with me to view the humility before God demonstrated by one young, very dear friend of mine.<\/p>\n<img alt=\"Easton Darrin Jolley\" id=\"img_tuQK9\" src=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/jec42qbbm63tn0uxonivrjjtxukf68kn77ktmrj6/full/%21500%2C/0/default\" data-img-id=\"jec42qbbm63tn0uxonivrjjtxukf68kn77ktmrj6\" srcset=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/jec42qbbm63tn0uxonivrjjtxukf68kn77ktmrj6/full/%2160%2C/0/default 60w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/jec42qbbm63tn0uxonivrjjtxukf68kn77ktmrj6/full/%21100%2C/0/default 100w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/jec42qbbm63tn0uxonivrjjtxukf68kn77ktmrj6/full/%21200%2C/0/default 200w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/jec42qbbm63tn0uxonivrjjtxukf68kn77ktmrj6/full/%21250%2C/0/default 250w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/jec42qbbm63tn0uxonivrjjtxukf68kn77ktmrj6/full/%21320%2C/0/default 320w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/jec42qbbm63tn0uxonivrjjtxukf68kn77ktmrj6/full/%21500%2C/0/default 500w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/jec42qbbm63tn0uxonivrjjtxukf68kn77ktmrj6/full/%21640%2C/0/default 640w\" data-assetId=\"jec42qbbm63tn0uxonivrjjtxukf68kn77ktmrj6\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"344\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.4534883720930232\" data-public-title=\"Portrait of Easton Jolley\" data-public-description=\"Closeup portrait of Easton Jolley\"/>\n<p data-aid=\"165187910\" id=\"p_k3sSJ\">On January 5, 2025\u201491 days ago\u2014Easton Darrin Jolley had the Aaronic Priesthood conferred upon him and was ordained a deacon in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187915\" id=\"p_wUcdT\">Easton had longed to pass the sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper for as long as he could remember. But this sacred opportunity was accompanied by the stomach-wrenching fear that he would fail, that he would fall, that he would be teased or embarrass himself and his family.<\/p>\n<img alt=\"Easton has a rare and very destructive illness.\" id=\"img_tnlKC\" src=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/c9kfk653wnxbyoa3rjpmdvt4g7j7tyr68gmnlhce/full/%21500%2C/0/default\" data-img-id=\"c9kfk653wnxbyoa3rjpmdvt4g7j7tyr68gmnlhce\" srcset=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/c9kfk653wnxbyoa3rjpmdvt4g7j7tyr68gmnlhce/full/%2160%2C/0/default 60w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/c9kfk653wnxbyoa3rjpmdvt4g7j7tyr68gmnlhce/full/%21100%2C/0/default 100w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/c9kfk653wnxbyoa3rjpmdvt4g7j7tyr68gmnlhce/full/%21200%2C/0/default 200w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/c9kfk653wnxbyoa3rjpmdvt4g7j7tyr68gmnlhce/full/%21250%2C/0/default 250w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/c9kfk653wnxbyoa3rjpmdvt4g7j7tyr68gmnlhce/full/%21320%2C/0/default 320w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/c9kfk653wnxbyoa3rjpmdvt4g7j7tyr68gmnlhce/full/%21500%2C/0/default 500w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/c9kfk653wnxbyoa3rjpmdvt4g7j7tyr68gmnlhce/full/%21640%2C/0/default 640w\" data-assetId=\"c9kfk653wnxbyoa3rjpmdvt4g7j7tyr68gmnlhce\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"336\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.4880952380952381\" data-public-title=\"Easton Jolley poses in his motorized wheelchair in front of a painting of Christ\" data-public-description=\"Easton Jolley poses in his motorized wheelchair in front of a painting of Christ\"/>\n<p data-aid=\"165187920\" id=\"p_s8RHF\">You see, Easton has a rare and very destructive illness, Ullrich congenital muscular dystrophy. It has progressively filled his young life with formidable challenges while shattering his hopes and dreams for the future. He will soon be in a wheelchair permanently. His family does not talk about what awaits him after that.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187925\" id=\"p_fErAI\">The Sunday after his ordination, Easton would pass the sacrament for the first time. And his privately held motivation was that he could present himself and these sacred emblems to his father, who was the bishop of the ward. In anticipating that task, he had begged and pled and wept and begged, extracting a guarantee that no one, <em>no one<\/em>, would try to help him. For many reasons, private to himself, he needed to do this alone and unaided.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187930\" id=\"p_j9FEd\">After the priest had broken the bread and blessed it\u2014an emblem representing the broken body of Christ\u2014Easton, with his broken body, limped up to receive his tray. However, there were three sizable steps from the meetinghouse floor to the elevated stand. So, after receiving his tray, he stretched up as high as he could and placed his tray on the surface above the handrail. Then, sitting down on one of the higher steps, with both hands he pulled his right leg up onto the first step. Then he pulled his left leg onto the same step, and so on up until, arduously, he was at the summit of his personal three-step Mount Everest.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187935\" id=\"p_gVr3B\">He then maneuvered himself to a structural post by which he could climb to a standing position. He made his way back to the tray. A few more steps and he stood in front of the bishop, his father, who, with tears drenching his eyes and flooding down his face, had to restrain himself from embracing this perfectly courageous and faithful son. And Easton, with relief and a broad smile consuming his face, might well have said, \u201cI have glorified [my father and] have finished the work [he gave] me to do.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"12\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187940\" id=\"p_qeqwI\">Faith, loyalty, purity, trust, honor, and, in the end, love for that father he so wished to please.

I testify that a humble and pure Russell M. Nelson is God\u2019s ordained and gifted prophet and seer. Coming from a lifetime of reading, I bear witness that the Book of Mormon is the most rewarding book I have ever read and the keystone of my little dwelling in a kingdom of many mansions. I bear witness that priesthood and prayer are restoring my life\u2014Christ\u2019s priesthood and your prayers.
