This changed when an illness left him unable to work, which was followed by a divorce. The years since have been difficult, but his love for his children and the covenants he has made with God have sustained him. One day he learned that his former spouse had remarried and had requested a cancellation of their temple sealing. He was troubled and confused. He sought peace and understanding in the house of the Lord. The day after his visit, I received the following message from him:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189336\" id=\"p_pwKMM\">\u201cI had an amazing experience in the temple last night. I think it was obvious that I still held quite a bit of resentment. \u2026 I knew that I must change, and I have been praying all week to do so. \u2026 Last night in the temple I literally felt the Spirit remove the resentment from my heart. \u2026 It was such a relief to be freed from it. \u2026 An ominous physical burden bearing down on me has been lifted.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189341\" id=\"p_tbMqq\">While he still has his challenges, my friend treasures that experience in the house of the Lord, where the liberating power of the love of God has helped him to feel closer to God, more optimistic about life, and less anxious about his future.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189345\" id=\"p_bVTCg\">When we experience the love of God, we can bear up our burdens with ease and submit patiently and cheerfully to His will. We have confidence that God will remember His covenants with us, visit us in our afflictions, and deliver us from bondage.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note16\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"16\"><\/sup><\/a> We will also desire to share the joy we feel with our family and loved ones.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note17\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"17\"><\/sup><\/a> As with Lehi\u2019s family, each person has agency to choose whether to partake of the fruit or not, but our opportunity is to love, share, and invite in such a way that those we love can feel the love of God.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189347\" id=\"p_oagh8\">To help others feel God\u2019s love, we need to cultivate in ourselves Christlike attributes such as humility, charity, compassion, and patience and help turn others towards the Savior through following the two great commandments of loving God and loving our fellow men.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note18\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"18\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189355\" id=\"p_rjysg\">One of our sons struggled with fitting in and self-esteem during his teenage years. My wife and I prayed to know how to help him, and we were willing to do whatever the Lord would have us do. One day I felt prompted to ask my elders quorum president if he knew of anyone in need who I could visit together with my son. After some thought, he asked us to visit a woman with significant health challenges and, with permission from the branch president, to bring the sacrament to her each week. I was elated but also concerned about how my son would react to this weekly commitment.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189360\" id=\"p_z7jMb\">On our first visit, our hearts ached for this dear woman, as she was in constant pain. She was very grateful for the sacrament, and we enjoyed visiting with her and her husband. After a few visits, one Sunday I was away and could not accompany my son, but I reminded him of our assignment. When I got home, I couldn\u2019t wait to hear how the visit went. My son replied that he didn\u2019t think his classmates got to do cool things like this. And he elaborated by saying that he brought his brother with him to help and that the sacrament went smoothly, but this dear sister had been sad during the week because she had invited friends to her home to watch movies, but her video player would not work. My son said he searched online, found the problem, and fixed it for her on the spot. He felt useful, happy, and trusted to do something that brightened her day.
