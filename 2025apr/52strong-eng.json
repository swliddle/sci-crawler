Nelson recently invited us to \u201cmake our discipleship our highest priority.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"1\"><\/sup><\/a> That powerful invitation has stirred me to ponder deeply about my personal discipleship of Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n<section id=\"sec_mTdua\">\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"165189214\" id=\"p_bjI75\">Discipleship Is Deliberate<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"165189221\" id=\"p_eXFpN\">A disciple is a follower or student of another.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"2\"><\/sup><\/a> Disciples are \u201capprentices\u201d who devote their lives to becoming like their teacher. Thus, being a disciple of Jesus Christ implies more than believing His teachings and doctrine. It even implies more than acknowledging His divinity and accepting Him as our Savior and Redeemer, as vitally important as that is.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189229\" id=\"p_rv85s\">President Dallin H. Oaks explained: \u201cFollowing Christ is not a casual or occasional practice. It is a continuous commitment and way of life that should guide us at all times and in all places.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"3\"><\/sup><\/a> Discipleship is a deliberate journey that we take to become transformed through the Lord\u2019s atoning sacrifice and His enabling power. The real destination of discipleship is literally to become as Jesus Christ is\u2014even to the point where we receive \u201chis image in [our] countenances.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"4\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189235\" id=\"p_kaiQ9\">To be the Lord\u2019s disciples, we must intentionally imitate His thoughts and actions every day\u2014for example, His obedience, humility, and patience. As we gradually incorporate these attributes into our own identities, we become \u201cpartakers of [His] divine nature.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"5\"><\/sup><\/a> This emulation of the Savior\u2019s character is at the heart of worshipping Him. As President Nelson taught, \u201cOur adoration of Jesus is best expressed by our emulation of Jesus.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"6\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"sec_yA9JS\">\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"165189241\" id=\"p_ttLJP\">The Sign of True Discipleship<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"165189248\" id=\"p_upXFX\">Of all the many divine attributes of Jesus Christ we are to emulate, one stands preeminent and embodies all others. That attribute is His pure love, or charity. Both the prophet Mormon and the Apostle Paul remind us that without charity, \u201c[we] are nothing.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"7\"><\/sup><\/a> Or, as revealed to the Prophet Joseph Smith, without \u201ccharity, [we] can <em>do<\/em> nothing.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"8\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189254\" id=\"p_i7ATn\">The Savior Himself identified love as a mark or sign by which His true disciples would be recognized when He declared:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189260\" id=\"p_sBJGu\">\u201cA new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, that ye also love one another.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189266\" id=\"p_iXiSd\">\u201cBy <em>this shall all men know that ye are my disciples<\/em>, if ye have love one to another.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"9\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189273\" id=\"p_z3wNL\">Charity is a rich concept that can be difficult to define but is easily perceived by all who are touched by it. <cite>Preach My Gospel<\/cite> teaches that \u201ccharity, like faith, leads to action.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"10\"><\/sup><\/a> Indeed, charity may be described as \u201clove in action.\u201d This description provides great insight into the summary statement of the Savior\u2019s life\u2014He \u201cwent about doing good.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"11\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189282\" id=\"p_nDuVu\">As followers of Jesus Christ, we should seek to emulate the way our Master demonstrated His pure love for others. Although the Savior manifests charity in many ways, I would like to call attention to three particular patterns of His charity that are readily seen in His true disciples.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"sec_gfmOk\">\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"165189289\" id=\"p_tv5Av\">Charity Is Showing Compassion<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"165189295\" id=\"p_kMLAm\">First, the Savior showed charity by being compassionate. During His ministry among the Nephites, as recorded in the Book of Mormon, the Lord invited the people to return home and ponder on the things He had taught and to prepare for His return the following day.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"12\"><\/sup><\/a> The record then states:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189301\" id=\"p_tTMdU\">\u201cThey were in tears, and did look steadfastly upon him as if they would ask him to tarry a little longer with them.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189304\" id=\"p_gMAw5\">\u201cAnd he said unto them: Behold, my bowels are filled with compassion towards you.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"13\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189312\" id=\"p_y9uGi\">Compassion is the portion of charity that seeks to alleviate suffering.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note14\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"14\"><\/sup><\/a> Filled with compassion, the Lord healed the sick and afflicted among the people. Afterward, He blessed their children while angels descended from heaven and surrounded them.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note15\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"15\"><\/sup><\/a> He performed these tender, loving acts, and many more, because He was \u201cmoved with compassion.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note16\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"16\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189317\" id=\"p_cNyeB\">While serving as a young missionary in South America, I likewise benefited from the compassion of a dear friend. One evening while I was driving with my companion to the home of our mission president, a young man on a bicycle turned suddenly in front of the vehicle. It happened so quickly that I could not avoid the collision. Tragically, this young man was killed by the impact. I was devastated over the loss of his life. Terrified and in shock as the awful reality of what had just occurred crashed down upon me, I was taken to jail and locked up.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note17\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"17\"><\/sup><\/a> I have never felt more frightened and alone. I was filled with despair and fear that I would be imprisoned for the rest of my life.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189322\" id=\"p_zeYpU\">A fellow missionary, Elder Brian Kochevar, learned of the accident and was moved by compassion. He came to the jail and pled with the officers to be allowed to stay with me in the cell so that I would not be alone. Miraculously, they agreed. To this day, I feel profound gratitude for this disciple\u2019s act of Christlike love, which calmed, comforted, and consoled me during the greatest moment of distress in my life.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note18\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"18\"><\/sup><\/a> His charitable compassion was a telling sign of his discipleship. As President Nelson observed, \u201cOne of the easiest ways to identify a <em>true follower<\/em> of Jesus Christ is how compassionately that person treats other people.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note19\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"19\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"sec_cv4fG\">\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"165189329\" id=\"p_c9nPq\">Charity Is Ministering to Unspoken Needs<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"165189332\" id=\"p_defgm\">Another example of how the Savior demonstrates His love is through His observance of and ministry to the unspoken needs of others. To the man who had been lame for 38 years with no one to help him, the Lord made him whole and encouraged him to live righteously.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note20\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"20\"><\/sup><\/a> To the woman caught in adultery, He offered hope and comfort rather than condemnation.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note21\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"21\"><\/sup><\/a> For the man with paralysis who was lowered from the roof, the Lord offered forgiveness of sins, not just healing of body.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note22\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"22\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189339\" id=\"p_zTD2H\">When I was called to serve as a bishop, our six young children made sacrament meetings challenging for my wife, Cristin, who had to manage them alone while I sat on the stand. As you may imagine, our children were often less than reverent. Noticing her situation, two members of our ward, John and Debbie Benich, began sitting with her each Sunday to help. Their kindness continued for years, and they became surrogate grandparents to our family. Like the Lord, these disciples had noticed the unspoken need and acted in love\u2014a prominent sign of their discipleship.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"sec_ta37j\">\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"165189342\" id=\"p_sKkCK\">Charity Is Helping Others Along the Covenant Path<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"165189349\" id=\"p_cZn89\">Lastly, the Savior\u2019s perfect love is focused on enabling all of God\u2019s children to fulfill our divine potential that we may \u201cpartake of his salvation, and the power of his redemption.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note23\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"23\"><\/sup><\/a> As we become more like our Master, our desire to help our brothers and sisters along the covenant path will naturally increase.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189352\" id=\"p_tCwaa\">For instance, we can uplift and befriend those who feel offended or forgotten, help those who are new to our congregation feel welcome, or invite friends to worship with us at sacrament meeting\u2014perhaps this coming Easter.

As an example, during my current assignment in the Philippines, I learned of the Agamata family. They were baptized in 2023, and then they eagerly set a date to be sealed as a family in the nearby Urdaneta Philippines Temple. However, just before the family\u2019s appointment, several typhoons struck the region. Brother Agamata, a rice farmer, was unable to plant his crops during the harsh storms. When the tempests finally passed, he needed to quickly plant the rice while the ground was soaked with water\u2014ideal conditions for planting. Sadly, the temple trip would have to be postponed.<\/p>\n<img alt=\"Missionaries help plant rice.\" id=\"img_ieyQ0\" src=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/e0n0vt2w1602ojis32yfxwtupvdahl8nzv2wxrvp/full/%21500%2C/0/default\" data-img-id=\"e0n0vt2w1602ojis32yfxwtupvdahl8nzv2wxrvp\" srcset=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/e0n0vt2w1602ojis32yfxwtupvdahl8nzv2wxrvp/full/%2160%2C/0/default 60w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/e0n0vt2w1602ojis32yfxwtupvdahl8nzv2wxrvp/full/%21100%2C/0/default 100w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/e0n0vt2w1602ojis32yfxwtupvdahl8nzv2wxrvp/full/%21200%2C/0/default 200w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/e0n0vt2w1602ojis32yfxwtupvdahl8nzv2wxrvp/full/%21250%2C/0/default 250w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/e0n0vt2w1602ojis32yfxwtupvdahl8nzv2wxrvp/full/%21320%2C/0/default 320w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/e0n0vt2w1602ojis32yfxwtupvdahl8nzv2wxrvp/full/%21500%2C/0/default 500w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/e0n0vt2w1602ojis32yfxwtupvdahl8nzv2wxrvp/full/%21640%2C/0/default 640w\" data-assetId=\"e0n0vt2w1602ojis32yfxwtupvdahl8nzv2wxrvp\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"281\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.7793594306049823\" data-public-title=\"Sister Nemah Agamata and other missionaries pose in a rice paddy in Cambodia\" data-public-description=\"Sister Nemah Agamata and other missionaries pose in a rice paddy in Cambodia\"/>\n<img alt=\"Missionaries planting rice.\" id=\"img_x3KoG\" src=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/q0trz01btegdcnynxohqn3n6js3weqpdmqmho6tl/full/%21500%2C/0/default\" data-img-id=\"q0trz01btegdcnynxohqn3n6js3weqpdmqmho6tl\" srcset=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/q0trz01btegdcnynxohqn3n6js3weqpdmqmho6tl/full/%2160%2C/0/default 60w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/q0trz01btegdcnynxohqn3n6js3weqpdmqmho6tl/full/%21100%2C/0/default 100w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/q0trz01btegdcnynxohqn3n6js3weqpdmqmho6tl/full/%21200%2C/0/default 200w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/q0trz01btegdcnynxohqn3n6js3weqpdmqmho6tl/full/%21250%2C/0/default 250w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/q0trz01btegdcnynxohqn3n6js3weqpdmqmho6tl/full/%21320%2C/0/default 320w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/q0trz01btegdcnynxohqn3n6js3weqpdmqmho6tl/full/%21500%2C/0/default 500w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/q0trz01btegdcnynxohqn3n6js3weqpdmqmho6tl/full/%21640%2C/0/default 640w\" data-assetId=\"q0trz01btegdcnynxohqn3n6js3weqpdmqmho6tl\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"281\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.7793594306049823\" data-public-title=\"Missionaries plant rice in Cambodia\" data-public-description=\"Missionaries plant rice in Cambodia\"/>\n<p data-aid=\"165189363\" id=\"p_hxR7r\">Two disciples, Elder and Sister Cauilan, along with three young service missionaries, heard of the Agamata family\u2019s struggle and offered help despite having no farming experience.
