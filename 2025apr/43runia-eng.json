Runia<\/p>\n<p class=\"author-role\" data-aid=\"165188185\" id=\"p_a5Jii\">First Counselor in the Young Women General Presidency<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"kicker\" data-aid=\"165188197\" id=\"p_nUqQl\">The invitation to repent is an expression of God\u2019s love. Saying yes to that invitation is an expression of ours.<\/p>\n<\/header>\n<div class=\"body-block\">\n<p data-aid=\"165188213\" id=\"p_os0Cn\">Several years ago on a trip to Florida, I sat outside reading a book. Its title suggested that we can still make it to heaven, even though we\u2019re not perfect now. A woman walking by asked, \u201cDo you think it\u2019s possible?\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188225\" id=\"p_rMSC7\">I looked up, confused, and then realized she was talking about the book I was reading. I said something ridiculous like, \u201cWell, I\u2019m not that far into it, but I\u2019ll let you know how it ends.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188238\" id=\"p_rzyM3\">Oh, how I wish I could travel back in time! I\u2019d tell her, \u201cYes, it\u2019s possible! Because heaven isn\u2019t for people who\u2019ve been perfect; it\u2019s for people who\u2019ve been forgiven, who choose Christ again and again.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165190251\" id=\"p_fDw1o\">Today I want to speak to those of us who sometimes feel, \u201cRepentance and forgiveness seem to be working for everyone but me.\u201d Those who privately wonder, \u201cSince I keep making the same mistakes, maybe this is the way I am.\u201d Those who, like me, have days when the covenant path feels so steep, it\u2019s almost a covenant hike!<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165190264\" id=\"p_ep3X9\">A wonderful missionary in Australia, Elder QaQa<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"1\"><\/sup><\/a> from Fiji, shared a similar feeling in his departing testimony: \u201cI know that God loves me, but sometimes I wonder, \u2018Does God know that I love Him?\u2019 Because I\u2019m not perfect, and I still make mistakes.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165190277\" id=\"p_qCKtb\">In that one tender, haunting question, Elder QaQa summed up exactly what I\u2019ve often worried about. Maybe you\u2019re wondering too, thinking, \u201cI\u2019m trying so hard, but does God know I\u2019m really trying? When I keep falling short, does God know I still love Him?\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165190290\" id=\"p_qCpM7\">It saddens me to admit this, but I used to measure my relationship with the Savior by how perfectly I was living. I thought an obedient life meant I would never need to repent. And when I made mistakes, which was every single day, I distanced myself from God, thinking, \u201cHe must be so disappointed in me.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165190302\" id=\"p_lutWh\">That\u2019s just not true.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165190314\" id=\"p_ui6Gz\">I\u2019ve learned that if you wait until you\u2019re clean enough or perfect enough to go to the Savior, you\u2019ve missed the whole point!<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165190326\" id=\"p_xcciN\">What if we thought about commandments and obedience in a different way?<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165190336\" id=\"p_fMtNw\">I testify that while God cares about our mistakes, He cares more about what happens <em>after<\/em> we make a mistake. Are we going to turn to Him again and again? Are we going to stay in this covenant relationship?<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165190346\" id=\"p_owOTq\">Maybe you hear the Lord\u2019s words \u201cIf [you] love me, keep my commandments\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"2\"><\/sup><\/a> and feel deflated because you haven\u2019t kept all the commandments. Let me remind you that it is also a commandment to repent! In fact, it might be the most repeated commandment in the scriptures.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165190357\" id=\"p_bnkrX\">In Alma\u2019s soliloquy, \u201cO that I were an angel, and could have the wish of [my] heart \u2026 and cry repentance,\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"3\"><\/sup><\/a> he wasn\u2019t trying to shame us by pointing out our mistakes.

Maybe you woke up this morning, said a meaningful prayer, and searched the scriptures to hear God\u2019s voice.

It was given to you by God, and there\u2019s nothing you or anyone else can do to change it. Obedience brings blessings; that is true. But worth isn\u2019t one of them. Your worth is always \u201cgreat in the sight of God,\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note21\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"21\"><\/sup><\/a> no matter where your decisions have taken you.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165190644\" id=\"p_pHm9O\">While I make mistakes, I want to <em>stay<\/em> in covenant relationship with Christ, and I\u2019ll tell you why.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165190652\" id=\"p_rH2Vi\">I grew up taking diving lessons and learned that when judges score a dive, they watch the execution.
