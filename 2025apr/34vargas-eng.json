At that time, my job took me across the ocean, rivers, and lakes of the beautiful Chilean Patagonia.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"1\"><\/sup><\/a> After my baptism, I saw my work and my life in a new and different way, recognizing that truly \u201call things denote there is a God.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"2\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188175\" id=\"p_jd7b8\">In nature, salmon are born in the source of the rivers. At some point in their lives, they need to swim downriver to reach the ocean, where they find the nourishment and conditions necessary for their development.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188186\" id=\"p_vgzE2\">But the ocean is also a dangerous place where predators lurk and where fishers try to catch the salmon with flashy hooks that imitate food but do not nourish them. If the salmon can survive these threats, they will be ready to use their powerful guidance system to return upriver to the same place where they were born, facing new and some familiar challenges. Scientists have studied their migratory behavior for years and have discovered that they use a type of magnetic map, similar to GPS, to guide them to their final destination with incredible precision.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"3\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188198\" id=\"p_iY6S7\">We can all return one day to the heavenly home from where we came. And like the salmon, we have our own magnetic map, or Light of Christ, to guide us there. Jesus taught His disciples, \u201cI am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"4\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188209\" id=\"p_kHQ6S\">As we focus our lives on Jesus Christ, we will find our way home, enduring to the end and rejoicing to the end. President Russell M. Nelson taught that \u201cthe joy we feel has little to do with the circumstances of our lives and everything to do with the focus of our lives.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"5\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"165188224\" id=\"p_aYRNv\">Our Divine Nature and Destiny<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"165188237\" id=\"p_gHkfA\">From the family proclamation, we read that \u201ceach [of us] is a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents, and, as such, each has a divine nature and destiny. \u2026 In the premortal realm, spirit sons and daughters knew and worshipped God as their Eternal Father and accepted His plan by which His children could obtain a physical body and gain earthly experience to progress toward perfection and ultimately realize their divine destiny as heirs of eternal life.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"6\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165190250\" id=\"p_r5XPQ\">Before His birth in mortality, Jesus Christ appeared to Moses and spoke to him on behalf of the Father. He told Moses He had a great work for him to do. During that meeting, the Lord called him \u201cmy son\u201d several times.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165190263\" id=\"p_z470X\">After that experience, Satan came tempting him, saying, \u201cMoses, son of man, worship me.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165190276\" id=\"p_dsVTL\">Moses responded to the temptation by remembering his divine nature, saying, \u201cWho art thou? For behold, I am a son of God.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"7\"><\/sup><\/a> The truth freed Moses from an attack by the adversary.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165190289\" id=\"p_qsvJ8\">Brothers and sisters, the hooks of mortality are real. They are often enticing, but they seek only one target: to pull us out of the course of living waters that lead to the Father and eternal life.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165190301\" id=\"p_yCeBn\">I know how real the hooks of mortality can be. One Sunday, as a new convert, I was teaching a priesthood class when an unsettling conversation arose. I struggled to finish my lesson. I took offense and felt that I was the victim. Without saying a word, I headed for the exit with the idea that I would not return to church for a while.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165190313\" id=\"p_wRlcN\">At that very moment, a concerned priesthood holder stood in front of me. He lovingly invited me to focus on Christ and not on the situation we had experienced in class. As I looked back on the experience with him, he shared with me that he heard a voice tell him, \u201cGo after him; he is important to me.\u201d<\/p>\n<img alt=\"Elder Vargas and the leader who went after him.\" id=\"img_ucVHt\" src=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/fkccwkub9fertggsf6kup153ltul75c3cnmyva94/full/%21500%2C/0/default\" data-img-id=\"fkccwkub9fertggsf6kup153ltul75c3cnmyva94\" srcset=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/fkccwkub9fertggsf6kup153ltul75c3cnmyva94/full/%2160%2C/0/default 60w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/fkccwkub9fertggsf6kup153ltul75c3cnmyva94/full/%21100%2C/0/default 100w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/fkccwkub9fertggsf6kup153ltul75c3cnmyva94/full/%21200%2C/0/default 200w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/fkccwkub9fertggsf6kup153ltul75c3cnmyva94/full/%21250%2C/0/default 250w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/fkccwkub9fertggsf6kup153ltul75c3cnmyva94/full/%21320%2C/0/default 320w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/fkccwkub9fertggsf6kup153ltul75c3cnmyva94/full/%21500%2C/0/default 500w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/fkccwkub9fertggsf6kup153ltul75c3cnmyva94/full/%21640%2C/0/default 640w\" data-assetId=\"fkccwkub9fertggsf6kup153ltul75c3cnmyva94\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"476\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.050420168067227\" data-public-title=\"Elder Sergio R.

President Nelson taught that \u201cbecause of our covenant with God, He will never tire in His efforts to help us, and we will never exhaust His merciful patience with us.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"8\"><\/sup><\/a> Our divine nature and covenant relationship with God entitle us to receive divine help.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"165190332\" id=\"p_vlRo7\">The Need of Nourishment<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"165190345\" id=\"p_fqvHa\">Just as salmon need to be nourished in the ocean to grow, we also need to nourish ourselves spiritually to avoid dying of spiritual malnutrition.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"9\"><\/sup><\/a> Prayer, the scriptures, the temple, and our regular attendance at Sunday meetings are vital in our spiritual menu.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165190356\" id=\"p_esbHP\">In November 1956, Ricardo García entered the waters of baptism in Chile, becoming the first member of the Church in my country.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"10\"><\/sup><\/a> Just one day before he died, he declared before his family and friends, \u201cMany years ago, missionaries invited me to be happy along with my family.

His example of discipleship has blessed generations, including me. The Prophet Joseph Smith taught that \u201ca man filled with the love of God, is not content with blessing his family alone, but ranges through the whole world, anxious to bless the whole human race.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"12\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"165190378\" id=\"p_tnHG0\">Return to Our Heavenly Home<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"165190389\" id=\"p_huFaU\">Deep inside each of us is a desire to return to our heavenly home, and Jesus Christ is our heavenly guidance system. He is the way. His atoning sacrifice makes it possible for us to make sacred covenants with God. Once we make covenants, we will at times find ourselves swimming against the current. Danger, disappointment, temptation, and affliction will test our faith and spiritual strength. Ask for help. Jesus Christ understands and is always eager to share our burdens.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165190400\" id=\"p_uffUf\">Remember that He is known as \u201ca man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"13\"><\/sup><\/a> The Savior taught, \u201cIn the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note14\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"14\"><\/sup><\/a> His atoning sacrifice allows our sins to be forgiven to the point that He no longer remembers them.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note15\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"15\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165190411\" id=\"p_jCMCL\">We may not totally forget our sins as part of our mortal learning so we will remember not to repeat them.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note16\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"16\"><\/sup><\/a> Instead, we will remember Him as we take the sacrament at church every Sunday.
