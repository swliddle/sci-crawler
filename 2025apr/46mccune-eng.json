In her words:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189060\" id=\"p_o1193\">\u201cI saw him and thought he had this bright light in his countenance. He was very kind and fun to those around him, and I felt warmth. Before he left, I asked him some questions. A few days later, he came into my work again and asked if I could attend his church. I thought it might be helpful. I was worried for my children\u2019s future, as society seemed to be full of stress and darkness. I wanted my children to be like this man with a light in their countenance, spreading joy to others around them.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189068\" id=\"p_j93Zc\">\u201cOne day the missionaries taught us the law of tithing. My children said with excitement, \u2018We must pay our tithing, Mom.\u2019 I could see my children\u2019s faith at that moment. Before I joined the Church, I watched general conference and listened to President Russell M. Nelson speak. He announced new temples all over the world and said that a new temple would be built in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. I rejoiced and shed tears, even though I did not understand why. With this joy, I could tell that my faith and testimony were growing.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189076\" id=\"p_cMHQz\">Uyanga, like millions of others, is part of the great gathering of Israel in preparation for the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. She has begun her journey along the covenant path and has become a disciple of Christ. What does it mean to be a disciple of Christ? I appreciate the Japanese word for disciple\u2014<em>deshi<\/em>\u2014<em>de<\/em> meaning younger brother, and <em>shi<\/em> meaning child.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189082\" id=\"p_u3iGt\">Jesus Christ declared, \u201cI was in the beginning with the Father, and am the Firstborn.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"1\"><\/sup><\/a> Because of <em>who<\/em> He <em>is<\/em> and <em>what <\/em>He has <em>done<\/em>, we worship Him, we revere Him, we give glory to Him, and we follow Him. Christ has redeemed us,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"2\"><\/sup><\/a> and we are forever grateful for His infinite and atoning sacrifice.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189089\" id=\"p_jDtjw\">We have a Heavenly Father, who loves us as His children. His love for us is perfect. Jesus Christ and His mission illustrate God\u2019s love for us. As John wrote, \u201cFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"3\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189096\" id=\"p_iIBB8\">In our quest to understand what we do not know, we might sometimes rely on our familiar mortal experiences, or things we <em>do<\/em> know. For example, we can learn somewhat of God the Father through our own parenthood and mortal family relationships. However, we should be careful in applying these comparisons too far in our attempt to understand our Heavenly Father. The attributes of God the Father transcend any <em>less-than-perfect<\/em> attributes of a fallen man. God the Father is the perfect Father. He is perfectly loving, kind, patient, and understanding and is perfectly glorious. We can trust Him perfectly. The love of Christ reflects the love of God the Father and is a representation of that love.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189103\" id=\"p_kdTkp\">Jesus Christ is both the example and the means. <em>In<\/em> Christ, we can understand better the perfect attributes of the Father and His plan. <em>Through<\/em> Christ, we are given the enabling power to overcome the tendencies of natural men and women so that we might become more like the Father.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189110\" id=\"p_qTv7w\">Just like our Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ is perfectly merciful and just. These divine attributes of justice and mercy are not in opposition. They are complementary. Both justice and mercy illustrate God\u2019s perfect love for His children. We can trust God the Father and Jesus Christ because They are just and fair with all of us.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189117\" id=\"p_bG5Vx\">God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, are perfectly aligned in purpose and love. Because God and Jesus Christ love us, we are given the opportunity and privilege as true disciples to make covenants with Them. By our doing so, our relationship with Christ is expanded: \u201cAnd now, because of the covenant which ye have made ye shall be called the children of Christ, his sons, and his daughters; for behold, this day he hath spiritually begotten you; for ye say that your hearts are changed through faith on his name; therefore, ye are born of him and have become his sons and his daughters.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"4\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189124\" id=\"p_yFWb4\">As disciples, when we make and keep sacred covenants, we are blessed with spiritual power. We are connected to Christ and God the Father in a special relationship and can experience Their love and joy in a measure reserved for those who have made and kept covenants.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"5\"><\/sup><\/a> Our ability to sense a full measure of God\u2019s love, or to continue in His love, is contingent upon our righteous desires and actions.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"6\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189131\" id=\"p_vt25D\">In <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/nt/john/15?lang=eng&amp;id=p9#p9\">John chapter 15, verse 9<\/a>, we read, \u201cAs the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you.\u201d And <em>then<\/em> we are given an invitation: \u201cContinue ye in my love.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189138\" id=\"p_tffy0\">In the <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/nt/john/15?lang=eng&amp;id=p10#p10\">next verse<\/a>, we are given the way to continue in His love: \u201cIf ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father\u2019s commandments, and abide in his love.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189145\" id=\"p_kFEGZ\">We then see the purpose of keeping the commandments in <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/nt/john/15?lang=eng&amp;id=p11#p11\">verse 11<\/a>: \u201cThese things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"7\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189153\" id=\"p_llbBX\">Through true covenant discipleship, we can begin to understand better the nature of God and the joy that He wants all of His children to experience. We can also begin to understand some principles that at first might seem confusing. For example, how can God have a fulness of joy when some of His children are suffering so much? The answer lies in God\u2019s perfect perspective and in His perfect plan. He sees us from the beginning to our glorious potential future. He has provided a way, through His Son, Jesus Christ, for all of us, His children, to overcome the pains, suffering, sins, guilt, and loneliness of our mortality.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"8\"><\/sup><\/a> God has provided for us the way and the choice.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189160\" id=\"p_ceb1M\">Examples of those who have experienced joy through discipleship might help us to better understand this concept. Perhaps you have heard the phrase that we are only as happy as our most unhappy child. I have seen that this does not need to be the case. My 94-year-old mother has over 200 living descendants. At any given point, at least one of the 200 is going to be unhappy. If this statement were true, my mother would be in a perpetual state of unhappiness, which she isn\u2019t. Those who know her know how joyful she is.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189169\" id=\"p_xmpQC\">I now would like to share another experience. In January of 2019, my wife, Debbie, and I were invited into the office of President Nelson. He had positioned a chair close to us, and we sat almost knee to knee. After extending to us our current calling, President Nelson turned to Debbie and focused on her. He was kind, loving, gentle, and full of joy, like the perfect father or grandfather. He held Debbie\u2019s hand and patted it, reassuring her that it would be OK and that our family would be blessed. It seemed to us at that moment that we were the most important people to him and that he had all the time in the world for us. We left his office that Friday afternoon feeling reassured, loved, and joyful.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189178\" id=\"p_p6Htr\">On Monday we saw the news. During that same day that President Nelson had spent with us, one of his daughters had passed away from cancer. We were stunned. Our hearts were full as we mourned for him and his family. Our hearts were also full of gratitude for his Christlike attention to us while mourning for his daughter who was suffering.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189182\" id=\"p_f3mvo\">As we pondered this experience, we asked ourselves, \u201cHow could he be so kind, loving, and even joyful at such a difficult time?\u201d The answer is because <em>he knows<\/em>. He knows that Christ has been victorious. He knows he will be with his daughter again and will spend an eternity with her. Joy and eternal perspective come through being bound to the Savior by making and keeping covenants and through Christlike discipleship.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189187\" id=\"p_fIBs0\">President Nelson has taught: \u201cJust as the Savior offers peace that \u2018passeth all understanding\u2019 [<a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/nt/philip/4?lang=eng&amp;id=p7#p7\">Philippians 4:7<\/a>], He also offers an intensity, depth, and breadth of joy that defy human logic or mortal comprehension. For example, it doesn\u2019t seem possible to feel joy when your child suffers with an incurable illness or when you lose your job or when your spouse betrays you. Yet that is precisely the joy the Savior offers.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"9\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189195\" id=\"p_sO3Lr\">As we make and keep covenants, we will naturally turn outward and have a desire to help others feel the measure of joy and love we feel in our covenantal relationships. We can be part of the greatest cause on the earth today\u2014the gathering of Israel.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"10\"><\/sup><\/a> We can help to bring God\u2019s children to Christ. As the prophet Jacob taught, \u201cAnd blessed art thou; for because ye have been diligent in laboring with me in my vineyard, and have kept my commandments, and have brought unto me again the natural fruit, \u2026 ye shall have joy with me because of the fruit of my vineyard.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"11\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189202\" id=\"p_oeVnZ\">As we bind ourselves to act as covenant disciples, in whatever our level of capacity, our relationship with the Father and the Son is enriched, our joy enhanced, and our eternal perspective expanded.
