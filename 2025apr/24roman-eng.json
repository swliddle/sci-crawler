So one morning we dedicated time to practice. When our lesson was over and I was leaving the pool, I heard my friend shouting for help. He was drowning in the deep end of the pool.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188068\" id=\"p_wP8Nk\">I threw myself into the water and swam toward him while praying for help. As I grabbed his hand to pull him to the surface, my desperate friend climbed onto my back and put me in a choke hold. Now we were both drowning. Trying my best to reach the surface, I prayed with all my might for a miracle from God. Then, slowly but steadily, the power of God was manifest as I felt a hand propelling me toward the shallow end of the pool, bringing us to safety.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188074\" id=\"p_aHa9U\">This experience confirmed a profound lesson President Russell M. Nelson once taught: \u201cWhen you reach up for the Lord\u2019s power in your life with the same intensity that a drowning person has when grasping and gasping for air, power from Jesus Christ will be yours.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"1\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188080\" id=\"p_gRs9S\">Dear children and young people, today I want to talk to you about the essential principle of faith in Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n<section id=\"sec_dAQAR\">\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"165188086\" id=\"p_hglky\">Faith in Christ Means Trusting Him<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"165188092\" id=\"p_s9f2p\">What does it mean to have faith in Christ? Does it mean we <em>believe in Him<\/em> or have a testimony that He is real? That may be a start, but it\u2019s more than that. Have you ever thought of faith as <em>trust<\/em>?<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"2\"><\/sup><\/a> Think of the person you trust the most\u2014perhaps a family member or a friend. Why do you trust them? It is probably because you have seen their constant <em>love<\/em> and <em>help<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188098\" id=\"p_jpCV4\">When we have faith in Christ, we recognize His blessings and develop a relationship of trust with Him.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"3\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<section id=\"sec_mS3Zu\">\n<header>\n<h3 data-aid=\"165188105\" id=\"p_dcyOK\">How Can You Increase Your Trust in Christ?<\/h3>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"165188112\" id=\"p_uLIGC\">In a recent youth devotional, you were invited to meditate on a time in your life when you received a ray of heavenly light.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"4\"><\/sup><\/a> Try this exercise!<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188124\" id=\"p_gH1kQ\">Start by meditating about Christ and the happiness His Atonement and gospel bring to your life. Also, make a record of the \u201cspiritually defining memories\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"5\"><\/sup><\/a> where God has been there for you, for your loved ones, and for the people in the scriptures. Now, these testimonies will not bring power to your life until the Spirit etches them in the \u201cfleshy tables\u201d of your heart.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"6\"><\/sup><\/a> So ponder and record all God set in motion for these miracles to come at just the right time.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"7\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188145\" id=\"p_ay6UL\">Next, use this exercise as an opportunity to get closer to God. Pray to your Heavenly Father as if it were the first time. Express your love and gratitude for His blessings.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"8\"><\/sup><\/a> Even ask Him how He feels about you and about the direction your life is taking.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"9\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188155\" id=\"p_qqEmX\">If you are sincere and humble, you will hear His answer and begin a personal and lasting relationship with Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Not only that, but your religious habits will become meaningful! For instance, you will look forward to your prayers, personal study, and temple worship as opportunities to get to know Them and be with Them.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"sec_wx1Sa\">\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"165188165\" id=\"p_leb2e\">Faith Flourishes with Loyalty<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"165188176\" id=\"p_pVjc2\">Notice that faith sprouts as we trust in Jesus Christ and blooms as we are faithful and loyal to Him. If you want a true relationship with Christ, show Him by making covenants and honoring them with faithfulness and loyalty. Making covenants with Jesus Christ builds hope. Honoring them builds faith.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"10\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188187\" id=\"p_ataMH\">Let me use a personal example: When I was a child, I found my mother crying alone one day. When I asked her why, she gently said, \u201cI need you to be a good boy.\u201d Even though I knew that I was not the cause of her distress, I loved and trusted my mother like no one else and wanted to make her life less difficult. So, with tears in my eyes and with all the solemnity that a nine-year-old can have, I promised her that day I would always strive to be the best son and make her proud.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188199\" id=\"p_o0g4d\">Can you imagine the power that promise had\u2014and still has\u2014on me?<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188212\" id=\"p_kX6SO\">That promise with her would guide my life. Before making decisions, I would consider whether my actions would please her. The bond of this promise and the relationship with my mother were the anchors for my conduct throughout my life.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188223\" id=\"p_miroQ\">Years later, as I came to know Jesus Christ better, I already knew how to base my faith in Him.
