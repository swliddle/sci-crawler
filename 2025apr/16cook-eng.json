President Russell M. Nelson assigned me to dedicate the Casper Wyoming Temple late last year.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"1\"><\/sup><\/a> It was a profound, emotional, and spiritual experience. It brought into clear focus the role temples play in rescuing God\u2019s children through the Savior\u2019s Atonement.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187866\" id=\"p_jWnAr\">The stakes in the Casper Wyoming Temple District include a portion of the overland trail used by Latter-day Saint pioneers between 1847 and 1868. In preparation for the temple dedication, I reread some of the history of the trail along the Platte River near Casper and continuing to Salt Lake City. The trail had been a thoroughfare for hundreds of thousands of western emigrants. My primary emphasis was the more than 60,000 Latter-day Saint pioneers who traveled the trail.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187870\" id=\"p_jOW7z\">Most of our pioneers came by wagon, but about 3,000 crossed in 10 handcart companies. Eight of these handcart companies made the monumental trek with remarkable success and few deaths. The Willie and Martin handcart companies of 1856 were the exception.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"2\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187874\" id=\"p_bGGcW\">I reviewed the accounts of the Willie and Martin handcart companies from the time the terrible weather conditions commenced. I became intimately aware of the challenges they faced at the crossing of the Sweetwater River, Martin\u2019s Cove, Rocky Ridge, and Rock Creek Hollow.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"image no-print\" id=\"fig_n8PzK\">\n<img alt=\"Handcart pioneers in snow.\" id=\"img_wIrD5\" src=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/9y7ctx1wzvmqvilgk1o1kbupmvnqd2e2xawl9jhk/full/%21500%2C/0/default\" data-img-id=\"9y7ctx1wzvmqvilgk1o1kbupmvnqd2e2xawl9jhk\" srcset=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/9y7ctx1wzvmqvilgk1o1kbupmvnqd2e2xawl9jhk/full/%2160%2C/0/default 60w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/9y7ctx1wzvmqvilgk1o1kbupmvnqd2e2xawl9jhk/full/%21100%2C/0/default 100w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/9y7ctx1wzvmqvilgk1o1kbupmvnqd2e2xawl9jhk/full/%21200%2C/0/default 200w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/9y7ctx1wzvmqvilgk1o1kbupmvnqd2e2xawl9jhk/full/%21250%2C/0/default 250w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/9y7ctx1wzvmqvilgk1o1kbupmvnqd2e2xawl9jhk/full/%21320%2C/0/default 320w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/9y7ctx1wzvmqvilgk1o1kbupmvnqd2e2xawl9jhk/full/%21500%2C/0/default 500w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/9y7ctx1wzvmqvilgk1o1kbupmvnqd2e2xawl9jhk/full/%21640%2C/0/default 640w\" data-assetId=\"9y7ctx1wzvmqvilgk1o1kbupmvnqd2e2xawl9jhk\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"281\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.7793594306049823\" data-public-title=\"Between Storms by Albin Veselka\" data-public-description=\"Original painting hangs in the Casper, Wyoming temple.\"/>\n<div class=\"credit\">\n<p data-aid=\"165187878\" id=\"p_vdFCe\"><cite>Between Storms<\/cite>, by Albin Veselka<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<p data-aid=\"165187882\" id=\"p_mwtPm\">I had not been inside the Casper Temple prior to the dedication.

As I gazed at it, I thought, \u201cThis painting is correct; the vast majority of handcart pioneers did not experience tragedies.\u201d I could not help feeling that this is like life in general.

In a world of great beauty, there are also enormous challenges. As we turn to Jesus Christ, the Savior of the world, He rescues us from the storms of life through His Atonement in accordance with the Father\u2019s plan.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187897\" id=\"p_eodhH\">For me, the foyer was a perfect preparation for the temple ordinance rooms that allow us to receive the ordinances of exaltation, to make sacred covenants, and to fully accept and experience the blessings of the Savior\u2019s Atonement. The Father\u2019s plan of happiness is based on the Savior\u2019s atoning rescue.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187903\" id=\"p_p4tN7\">The pioneer experience provides Latter-day Saints with a unique historical tradition and a powerful collective spiritual legacy. For some, the migration had been years in the making after being forcefully driven from both Missouri and Nauvoo. For others, it began after President Brigham Young announced the handcart plan, which was intended to make emigration more affordable. The handcarts cost much less than wagons and oxen.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"7\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187907\" id=\"p_titcY\">A missionary in England, Millen Atwood, said that when the handcart plan was announced, \u201cit ran like fire in dry stubble, and the hearts of the poor Saints leapt with joy and gladness.\u201d Many had \u201cprayed and fasted day after day, and night after night, that they might have the privilege of uniting with their brethren and sisters in [the] mountains.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"8\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187912\" id=\"p_cVAdN\">Most of the handcart Saints experienced hardship but avoided major adverse events. But two handcart companies, the Willie company and the Martin company, experienced starvation, exposure to freezing weather, and many deaths.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"9\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187917\" id=\"p_o4aZT\">Most of these travelers sailed from Liverpool, England, in May of 1856 aboard two ships.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"10\"><\/sup><\/a> They arrived at the handcart outfitting site in Iowa City in June and July.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"11\"><\/sup><\/a> Despite warnings, both companies departed for the Salt Lake Valley too <em>late<\/em> in the season.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187922\" id=\"p_uTDVe\">President Brigham Young first became aware of the perilous situation of these companies on October 4, 1856. The next day he stood before the Saints in Salt Lake City and said, \u201cMany of our brethren and sisters are on the plains with handcarts, \u2026 and they must be brought here; we must send assistance to them \u2026 before the winter sets in.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"12\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187927\" id=\"p_onEuy\">He asked the bishops to provide 60 mule teams, 12 or more wagons, and 12 tons (10,886 kg) of flour and proclaimed, \u201cGo and bring in those people now on the plains.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"13\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187932\" id=\"p_bvr52\">The combined number of pioneers in the Willie and Martin handcart companies was approximately 1,100. Some 200 of these precious Saints died along the trail.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note14\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"14\"><\/sup><\/a> Without the timely rescue, many more would have perished.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187937\" id=\"p_u5QU1\">The winter storms began nearly two weeks after the first rescuers left Salt Lake City. The accounts of members of the Willie and Martin companies describe devastating challenges after the storms began. These accounts also depict the great joy when the rescuers arrived.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187942\" id=\"p_s8JQr\">Describing the arrival scene, Mary Hurren said: \u201cTears streamed down the cheeks of the men, and the children danced for joy. As soon as the people could control their feelings, they all knelt down in the snow and gave thanks to God.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note15\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"15\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187947\" id=\"p_gct2P\">Two days later, the Willie company had to travel the most difficult part of the trail, going over Rocky Ridge, in a freezing storm. The last of them didn\u2019t reach camp until 5:00 the next morning. Thirteen people died and were buried in a common grave.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note16\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"16\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187952\" id=\"p_kxjKE\">On November 7, the Willie company was nearing the Salt Lake Valley, but that morning there were still three deaths.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note17\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"17\"><\/sup><\/a> Two days later, the Willie company finally reached Salt Lake, where they had a marvelous greeting and were welcomed into the homes of the Saints.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187956\" id=\"p_p5C5f\">That same day, the Martin company was still 325 miles (523 km) back on the trail, continuing to suffer from cold and inadequate food. A few days earlier, they had crossed the Sweetwater River to reach what is now called Martin\u2019s Cove, where they hoped to find protection from the elements. One of the pioneers said, \u201cIt was the worst river crossing of the expedition.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note18\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"18\"><\/sup><\/a> Some of the rescuers\u2014like my great-grandfather David Patten Kimball, who was just 17 years old, along with his young friends \u201cGeorge W. Grant, Allen Huntington, Stephen Taylor, and Ira Nebeker\u2014spent hours in the frigid water,\u201d heroically helping the company make the Sweetwater crossing.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note19\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"19\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187961\" id=\"p_hNmpZ\">While this event has received much attention, as I learned more about the rescuers, I realized that all of them were following the prophet and played critical roles in saving the stranded Saints. All the rescuers were heroic, as were the emigrants.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187966\" id=\"p_g7L1j\">Studying their story, I appreciated the precious relationships and the long-term eternal vision among the emigrants. John and Maria Linford and their three sons were members of the Willie company. John died hours before the first rescuers arrived. He had told Maria that he was glad they had made the journey. \u201cI shall not live to reach Salt Lake,\u201d he said, \u201cbut you and the boys will, and I do not regret all we have gone through if our boys can grow up and raise their families in Zion.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note20\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"20\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187971\" id=\"p_mIYmC\">President James E. Faust provided this marvelous summary: \u201cIn the heroic effort of the handcart pioneers, we learn a great truth. All must pass through a refiner\u2019s fire, and the insignificant and unimportant in our lives can melt away like dross and make our faith bright, intact, and strong. There seems to be a full measure of anguish, sorrow, and often heartbreak for everyone, including those who earnestly seek to do right and be faithful. Yet this is part of the purging to become acquainted with God.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note21\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"21\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187976\" id=\"p_gT6vM\">In His eternity-shaping Atonement and Resurrection, the Savior broke \u201cthe bands of death, having gained the victory over death\u201d for everyone.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note22\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"22\"><\/sup><\/a> For those who have repented of sins, He has \u201ctaken upon himself their iniquity and their transgressions, having redeemed them, and satisfied the demands of justice.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note23\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"23\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187982\" id=\"p_bs7Hb\">Without the Atonement, we cannot save ourselves from sin and death.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note24\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"24\"><\/sup><\/a> While sin can play a significant role in our trials, life\u2019s adversities are compounded by mistakes, bad decisions, evil actions by others, and many things outside of our control.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187987\" id=\"p_pndx8\"><em>Preach My Gospel<\/em> teaches: \u201cAs we rely on Jesus Christ and His Atonement, He can help us endure our trials, sicknesses, and pain. We can be filled with joy, peace, and consolation. All that is unfair about life can be made right through the Atonement of Jesus Christ.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note25\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"25\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187993\" id=\"p_fdeC3\">During this Easter season, our focus is on the Savior and His atoning sacrifice. The Atonement provides hope and light at a time that for many seems dark and dreary. President Gordon B. Hinckley declared, \u201cWhen all of history is examined, \u2026 [there is] nothing \u2026 so wonderful, so majestic, so tremendous as this act of grace.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note26\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"26\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187998\" id=\"p_l5MM9\">I share three recommendations which I think are particularly relevant for our day.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188004\" id=\"p_nMafv\">First, do not underestimate the importance of doing what we can to rescue others from physical and especially spiritual challenges.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note27\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"27\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188010\" id=\"p_eWxOB\">Second, gratefully accept the Savior\u2019s Atonement. We all should strive to exhibit joy and happiness even as we face the challenges of life. Our goal should be to live optimistically on the sunny side of the street. I have observed my precious companion, Mary, do this her entire life. I have appreciated her sparkling, uplifting approach even as we have faced problems throughout the years.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188016\" id=\"p_gxn4y\">My third counsel is to set aside consistent time to faithfully contemplate the Savior\u2019s Atonement. There are many ways to do this in our personal religious observance. However, attending sacrament meeting and partaking of the sacrament are especially significant.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188020\" id=\"p_mYsMt\">Equally important is regular attendance in a temple where possible. The temple provides a continuing remembrance of the Savior\u2019s Atonement and what it overcomes. And, even more important, temple attendance allows us to provide a spiritual rescue for our deceased loved ones and more distant ancestors.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188026\" id=\"p_oL0MU\">President Russell M. Nelson, at our last conference, emphasized this principle and added, \u201c[Temple] blessings \u2026 help to prepare a people who will help prepare the world for the Second Coming of the Lord!\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note28\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"28\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188033\" id=\"p_bNVQS\">We must never forget the sacrifices and examples of prior generations, but our adulation, appreciation, and worship should be centered on the Savior of the world and His atoning sacrifice. I testify that the key to the Father\u2019s plan of happiness is the Atonement wrought by our Savior, Jesus Christ. He lives and guides His Church. The Atonement of Jesus Christ provides the ultimate rescue from the trials we face in this life. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<footer class=\"notes\">\n<p class=\"title\" data-aid=\"165188040\" id=\"p_fIHMa\">Notes<\/p>\n<ol class=\"decimal\" data-type=\"marker\" start=\"1\">\n<li data-marker=\"1.\" id=\"note1\" data-full-marker=\"1.\">\n<p data-aid=\"165188046\" id=\"p_f7RcS\">The Casper Wyoming Temple was dedicated on November 24, 2024.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"2.\" id=\"note2\" data-full-marker=\"2.\">\n<p data-aid=\"165188052\" id=\"p_mRRMn\">I became aware of the Willie and Martin companies and the tragedies they faced when I was very young.
