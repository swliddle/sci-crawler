We love you, we are grateful for you, and we feel blessed by your prayers.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187863\" id=\"p_t5smj\">President Russell M. Nelson said at our last conference: \u201cDo you see what is happening right before our eyes? I pray that we will not miss the majesty of this moment! The Lord is indeed hastening His work.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"1\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187867\" id=\"p_nXEeN\">Hastening His work. \u201cHastening\u201d is a word that matters. It suggests moving quickly, accelerating, and even urgency. In the growth of the Church and the plan of Christ, hastening is happening. And we are all a part of it.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187871\" id=\"p_s8FPJ\">In April 1834 in Kirtland, Ohio, the Prophet Joseph Smith gathered all who held the priesthood into a little schoolhouse about 14 feet (4.3 m) square. We could fit dozens of those schoolhouses in this Conference Center, with room to spare. Joseph Smith said, \u201cIt is only a little handful of Priesthood you see here tonight, but this Church will fill North and South America\u2014it will fill the world.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"2\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187875\" id=\"p_nP4C7\">That prophecy is being fulfilled \u201cright before our eyes.\u201d The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is growing in members and families, missions and missionaries, meetinghouses and temples, and in enrollment in our seminaries, institutes, and universities all around the world.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187879\" id=\"p_uI0bj\">We are grateful to be on earth when the Church is increasing in numbers and influence, but more importantly in the hearts and lives of its members. We are known as disciples of Jesus Christ. We share our testimonies of Him, His Church, His ways, and His covenant path. We are His people, and He is our Savior.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187883\" id=\"p_aJ6FZ\">I marvel at what President Nelson calls the \u201cmajesty of this moment\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"3\"><\/sup><\/a> and express profound gratitude to the Lord for His work. I encourage us to stand tall as His disciples, eyewitnesses of the fulfillment of prophecy, both ancient and modern.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187887\" id=\"p_vqjy4\">There are naysayers who shout, \u201c\u2018Lo, here!\u2019 and \u2026 \u2018Lo, there!\u2019\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"4\"><\/sup><\/a> just as they did in the Prophet Joseph Smith\u2019s time. However, they are and will be but mere footnotes in this noble work. Remember the words of Joseph Smith: \u201cNo unhallowed hand can stop the work from progressing; persecutions may rage, \u2026 but the truth of God will go forth boldly, nobly, and independent, till it has penetrated every continent, visited every clime, swept every country, and sounded in every ear, till the purposes of God shall be accomplished, and the Great Jehovah shall say the work is done.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"5\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187890\" id=\"p_lbSEL\">In my assignments this year, I have had a front-row seat to the Lord hastening His work. The Church is building temples at an unprecedented pace, giving more members an opportunity to worship in the house of the Lord. Second, missionary work is gathering record numbers to the fold of the Good Shepherd, Jesus Christ. And third, Church education in many configurations is at a new high in teaching those who \u201cseek this Jesus.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"6\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187895\" id=\"p_x6WvL\">Today the Church has 367 temples in various stages of design, construction, or operation. And for what purpose? The answer is proclaimed on each temple: \u201cHoliness to the Lord.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"7\"><\/sup><\/a> The temple opens the way to the highest blessings our Father in Heaven has for each one of us. Brothers and sisters, we are hastening our holiness as we live temple worthy, as we worship in the house of the Lord, and as we make covenants with God for ourselves and on behalf of our ancestors on the other side of the veil.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187899\" id=\"p_fdLSz\">President Nelson has said: \u201cThe assaults of the adversary are increasing exponentially, in intensity and in variety. Our need to be in the temple on a regular basis has never been greater. I plead with you to take a prayerful look at how you spend your time.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"8\"><\/sup><\/a> In His house we can feel the Lord\u2019s hallowed presence and transcendent peace.<\/p>\n<img alt=\"Elder and Sister Rasband at the Mendoza Argentina Temple.\" id=\"img_fynmB\" src=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/0ex886q19bw7ftuejphptui00i4sy5ke5fa662rn/full/%21500%2C/0/default\" data-img-id=\"0ex886q19bw7ftuejphptui00i4sy5ke5fa662rn\" srcset=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/0ex886q19bw7ftuejphptui00i4sy5ke5fa662rn/full/%2160%2C/0/default 60w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/0ex886q19bw7ftuejphptui00i4sy5ke5fa662rn/full/%21100%2C/0/default 100w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/0ex886q19bw7ftuejphptui00i4sy5ke5fa662rn/full/%21200%2C/0/default 200w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/0ex886q19bw7ftuejphptui00i4sy5ke5fa662rn/full/%21250%2C/0/default 250w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/0ex886q19bw7ftuejphptui00i4sy5ke5fa662rn/full/%21320%2C/0/default 320w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/0ex886q19bw7ftuejphptui00i4sy5ke5fa662rn/full/%21500%2C/0/default 500w\" data-assetId=\"0ex886q19bw7ftuejphptui00i4sy5ke5fa662rn\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"749\" data-aspect-ratio=\"0.6675567423230975\" data-public-title=\"Elder and Sister Rasband stand in front of the Mendoza, Argentina Temple\" data-public-description=\"Elder and Sister Rasband stand in front of the Mendoza, Argentina Temple\"/>\n<p data-aid=\"165187902\" id=\"p_fLoXr\">Last year I was privileged to preside at the dedication of the Mendoza Argentina Temple. In my message, I referred to Elder Melvin J. Ballard\u2019s 1926 prophecy that the work of the Lord would grow slowly for a time in South America, \u201cjust as an oak grows slowly from an acorn. It will not shoot up in a day,\u201d but thousands would join the Church, and the nations of South America would become \u201ca power in the Church.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"9\"><\/sup><\/a> I saw that prophecy fulfilled right before my eyes.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187908\" id=\"p_n1uUe\">Mendoza, once a small acorn, has become a mighty oak. That growth is being repeated across continents and isles of the sea.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187913\" id=\"p_jwfg6\">We see the Lord hastening His work in missions.
