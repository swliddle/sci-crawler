This is His Church. We are gathered in buildings and homes all over the world in His name.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188482\" id=\"p_bxAKi\">We take His name upon us when we enter His kingdom by covenant. He is the resurrected and glorified Son of God. We are mortals, subject to sin and death. Yet, in His love for each of us, the Savior invites us to come closer to Him.<\/p>\n<img alt=\"The Savior emerging from the tomb.\" id=\"img_r5289\" src=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/kan5egnj6mvywzi3f56sdcso85cqnv1ftedzy9f3/full/%21500%2C/0/default\" data-img-id=\"kan5egnj6mvywzi3f56sdcso85cqnv1ftedzy9f3\" srcset=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/kan5egnj6mvywzi3f56sdcso85cqnv1ftedzy9f3/full/%2160%2C/0/default 60w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/kan5egnj6mvywzi3f56sdcso85cqnv1ftedzy9f3/full/%21100%2C/0/default 100w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/kan5egnj6mvywzi3f56sdcso85cqnv1ftedzy9f3/full/%21200%2C/0/default 200w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/kan5egnj6mvywzi3f56sdcso85cqnv1ftedzy9f3/full/%21250%2C/0/default 250w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/kan5egnj6mvywzi3f56sdcso85cqnv1ftedzy9f3/full/%21320%2C/0/default 320w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/kan5egnj6mvywzi3f56sdcso85cqnv1ftedzy9f3/full/%21500%2C/0/default 500w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/kan5egnj6mvywzi3f56sdcso85cqnv1ftedzy9f3/full/%21640%2C/0/default 640w\" data-assetId=\"kan5egnj6mvywzi3f56sdcso85cqnv1ftedzy9f3\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"281\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.7793594306049823\" data-public-title=\"He is Risen\" data-public-description=\"The resurrected Jesus Christ emerging from the Garden Tomb. Christ is portrayed stepping out of the tomb. He is depicted wearing white robes. Flowers are blooming near the entrance to the tomb.\"/>\n<p data-aid=\"165188484\" id=\"p_z3kdr\">Here is His invitation to us: \u201cDraw near unto me and I will draw near unto you; seek me diligently and ye shall find me; ask, and ye shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"1\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188486\" id=\"p_vERk8\">There are times we feel close to the Savior Jesus Christ. And yet, sometimes during our mortal trials, we feel some distance from Him and wish for an assurance that He knows what is in our hearts and loves us as individuals.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188488\" id=\"p_zaTOb\">The Savior\u2019s invitation includes the way to feel that assurance. Draw near Him by always remembering Him. Seek Him diligently through scripture study. Ask through heartfelt prayer to Heavenly Father to feel closer to His Beloved Son.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188490\" id=\"p_lIlXo\">There is a simple way to think about it. It is what you would do if you were separated for a time from dear friends. You would find a way to communicate with them, you would cherish any message you received from them, and you would do all you could to help them.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188492\" id=\"p_pQHfk\">The more that happened, the longer it lasted, the deeper the bond of affection would be strengthened, and you would feel yourself drawing ever nearer. If much time passed without the cherished communication and the opportunity to help one another, the bond would weaken.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188494\" id=\"p_utaqm\">Jesus Christ loves each of us. He offers that opportunity to draw closer to Him. As with a loving friend, you will do it in much the same way, by communicating through prayer to Heavenly Father in the name of Jesus Christ, listening for cherished guidance from the Holy Ghost, and then serving others for the Savior cheerfully. Soon you would feel that blessing of drawing nearer to Him.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188496\" id=\"p_nAvZL\">In my youth, I experienced the joy of coming closer to the Savior\u2014and of His coming closer to me\u2014through simple acts of obedience to the commandments. When I was young, the sacrament was offered during an evening meeting. I can still remember one specific night, more than 75 years ago, when it was dark and cold outside. I remember a feeling of light and warmth as I realized that I had kept the commandment to gather with the Saints to partake of the sacrament, covenanting with our Heavenly Father to always remember His Son and keep His commandments.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188497\" id=\"p_efxtc\">At the end of the meeting that night, we sang the hymn \u201cAbide with Me; \u2019Tis Eventide,\u201d with the memorable words \u201cO Savior, stay this night with me.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"2\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188499\" id=\"p_ePnaj\">These words brought an overwhelming sense of the Spirit to me, even as a young boy. I felt the Savior\u2019s love and closeness that evening through the comfort of the Holy Ghost.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188501\" id=\"p_yAYef\">Years later I wanted to rekindle the same feeling of the Savior\u2019s love and the closeness I had felt to the Lord during that sacrament meeting in my youth. So I kept another simple commandment: I searched the scriptures.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188503\" id=\"p_uVnZR\">In the book of Luke, I read of the third day after His Crucifixion and burial, when faithful servants had come, out of love for the Savior, to anoint His body. When they arrived, they found the stone rolled away from the tomb and saw that His body was not there.<\/p>\n<img alt=\"An angel outside of Christ\u2019s tomb.\" id=\"img_hCeVD\" src=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/12vnzn1q60f9cq7x5892cteewaqet9p7p188p66j/full/%21500%2C/0/default\" data-img-id=\"12vnzn1q60f9cq7x5892cteewaqet9p7p188p66j\" srcset=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/12vnzn1q60f9cq7x5892cteewaqet9p7p188p66j/full/%2160%2C/0/default 60w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/12vnzn1q60f9cq7x5892cteewaqet9p7p188p66j/full/%21100%2C/0/default 100w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/12vnzn1q60f9cq7x5892cteewaqet9p7p188p66j/full/%21200%2C/0/default 200w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/12vnzn1q60f9cq7x5892cteewaqet9p7p188p66j/full/%21250%2C/0/default 250w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/12vnzn1q60f9cq7x5892cteewaqet9p7p188p66j/full/%21320%2C/0/default 320w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/12vnzn1q60f9cq7x5892cteewaqet9p7p188p66j/full/%21500%2C/0/default 500w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/12vnzn1q60f9cq7x5892cteewaqet9p7p188p66j/full/%21640%2C/0/default 640w\" data-assetId=\"12vnzn1q60f9cq7x5892cteewaqet9p7p188p66j\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"281\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.7793594306049823\" data-public-title=\"Jesus Christ.
