This was a long-awaited invitation, as my father was a quorum leader and often went camping with the boys in the ward, while I was left at home.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189211\" id=\"p_sncsD\">When the day came, I was excited. And I must admit that I desperately wanted to fit in with the older boys. I was determined to prove myself. In that effort it wasn\u2019t long before I was tested to see if I would play along and be part of the group.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189218\" id=\"p_nSKhH\">My assigned task was to get my father\u2019s car keys so a prank could be pulled on the leaders. I don\u2019t remember exactly what I said to convince my dad, but I soon ran to the group of boys with keys in hand, proud of my accomplishment.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189224\" id=\"p_jmimb\">Then came the next assignment. I was to unlock the car door and wedge a stick between the driver\u2019s seat-back and the car horn. And I was to lock the door so the horn would blare into the evening without any way for the leaders to access the car to remove the crude device.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189231\" id=\"p_gkVNj\">Now, this is where the story turns painfully embarrassing for me. Once I secured the stick in place, I locked the door and ran as fast as I could to hide in a nearby patch of bushes. As I crouched down to the ground, I felt a searing pain. In the darkness and in my haste, I had sat upon a prickly pear cactus.<\/p>\n<img alt=\"Prickly pear cactus.\" id=\"img_l4V53\" src=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/o01em1at3xzzgz2p4vj5o5z4dk75p6zegajwvzrg/full/%21500%2C/0/default\" data-img-id=\"o01em1at3xzzgz2p4vj5o5z4dk75p6zegajwvzrg\" srcset=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/o01em1at3xzzgz2p4vj5o5z4dk75p6zegajwvzrg/full/%2160%2C/0/default 60w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/o01em1at3xzzgz2p4vj5o5z4dk75p6zegajwvzrg/full/%21100%2C/0/default 100w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/o01em1at3xzzgz2p4vj5o5z4dk75p6zegajwvzrg/full/%21200%2C/0/default 200w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/o01em1at3xzzgz2p4vj5o5z4dk75p6zegajwvzrg/full/%21250%2C/0/default 250w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/o01em1at3xzzgz2p4vj5o5z4dk75p6zegajwvzrg/full/%21320%2C/0/default 320w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/o01em1at3xzzgz2p4vj5o5z4dk75p6zegajwvzrg/full/%21500%2C/0/default 500w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/o01em1at3xzzgz2p4vj5o5z4dk75p6zegajwvzrg/full/%21640%2C/0/default 640w\" data-assetId=\"o01em1at3xzzgz2p4vj5o5z4dk75p6zegajwvzrg\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"281\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.7793594306049823\" data-public-title=\"A prickly pear cactus begins blooming in the desert\" data-public-description=\"A prickly pear cactus begins blooming in the desert\"/>\n<p data-aid=\"165189238\" id=\"p_c4LTu\">My screams of pain were drowned out by the blaring horn, and I had no recourse other than gingerly hobbling back to the car, confessing my \u201csins,\u201d and seeking rudimentary and embarrassing medical attention.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189245\" id=\"p_ofJji\">The remainder of that night, I lay on my stomach in a tent while my father, using pliers, removed the cactus spines from my \u2026 well, let me just say that I did not sit comfortably for several days afterward.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189252\" id=\"p_orpqo\">I have reflected on that experience many times. I can now laugh at the folly of my youth, even as some underlying principles have become clear to me.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189257\" id=\"p_oDKgx\">Many patterns in human behavior seem to be common in the natural man\u2014the desire to fit in, the desire to prove oneself, the fear of missing out, and the compelling need to hide so we avoid consequences. It is this final behavior I will focus on today\u2014hiding after we do something that we should not.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189263\" id=\"p_v6yAm\">Now, I am not equating my childish prank with grievous sin, but we can draw some parallels that may prove useful as we are tested in our mortal sojourn.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189269\" id=\"p_a82aR\">In the Garden of Eden, Adam and Eve had an idyllic circumstance\u2014an abundance of food, the incomparable beauty of the garden\u2014not only a garden of beauty but a garden with neither weeds nor prickly pears.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189277\" id=\"p_d8K2A\">However, we also know that garden life limited their needed progression. The garden was not a final destination but a test, the first of many that would prove, prepare, and allow them to progress to their final destination of returning to the presence of the Father and the Son.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189283\" id=\"p_dg33T\">You will remember that there was opposition in the garden. Lucifer was allowed to try Adam and Eve. He first tempted Adam to partake of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil. Remembering the commandment not to partake thereof, Adam resisted. Then came blessed Eve, who chose to partake of the fruit, convincing Adam to do likewise.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189290\" id=\"p_ej4TG\">Later, Adam and Eve declared that this decision was necessary to fulfill Heavenly Father\u2019s plan.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"1\"><\/sup><\/a> But by partaking of the fruit, they had transgressed the law\u2014a law given them directly from the Father. The resulting and crushing understanding of good and evil must have left them in anguish when they heard the voice of the Father announcing His return to the garden. They realized they were naked, for they were indeed without clothing, having lived in a state of innocence.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"2\"><\/sup><\/a> But perhaps more painful than their being without clothing in that moment, they were now exposed for their transgression. They were defenseless and vulnerable. They were naked in every sense of the word.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189296\" id=\"p_lBuPf\">Ever the opportunist, Lucifer, knowing their exposed and weakened state, tempted them yet again\u2014this time to hide from God.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189302\" id=\"p_x2KmQ\">This temptation\u2014I will call it the \u201csecond temptation\u201d\u2014is the temptation that may bring the greatest consequence if we succumb. Surely, to avoid all first temptations to break God\u2019s law is optimal, but we know that all will succumb to a variety of first temptations here on earth. As we progress in our maturity and understanding, we hope that our strength to avoid first temptations will continually improve as we strive to become more like our Savior, Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189306\" id=\"p_csiVl\">Some might attempt to hide from God because they don\u2019t want to be discovered or exposed, and they feel shame or guilt. However, numerous scriptures teach us that hiding from God is impossible. I\u2019ll share just a few.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189309\" id=\"p_od5uB\">The Lord teaches Jeremiah through the following questions: \u201cCan any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him? saith the Lord. Do not I fill heaven and earth?\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"3\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189313\" id=\"p_xGP82\">And Job is taught:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189320\" id=\"p_xI1vL\">\u201cFor his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his goings.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189324\" id=\"p_zRMWx\">\u201cThere is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers of iniquity may hide themselves.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"4\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189330\" id=\"p_tAn8d\">The psalmist David most poetically exclaims:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189335\" id=\"p_yGoJn\">\u201cO Lord, thou hast searched me, and known me.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189338\" id=\"p_af5HA\">\u201cThou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar off. \u2026<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189346\" id=\"p_wXZnN\">\u201cFor there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O Lord, thou knowest it altogether. \u2026<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189351\" id=\"p_jMp6Q\">\u201cWhither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee from thy presence?<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189357\" id=\"p_s0fB7\">\u201cIf I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed in hell, behold, thou art there.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"5\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<section id=\"sec_oUTjt\">\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"165189361\" id=\"p_aTWDh\">New Converts<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"165189369\" id=\"p_lpjnX\">For those who have recently joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the second temptation may seem particularly challenging. Through your baptism you have covenanted to take upon yourself the name of Jesus Christ, which for many includes a needed change of lifestyle. Changing one\u2019s lifestyle is not easy. Often it requires you to change habits and practices and even associations to progress toward your loving Heavenly Father.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189373\" id=\"p_gP4Db\">The adversary knows that you may be vulnerable to his subtle attacks. He will make your past life, which left you unsatisfied in so many ways, now seem unrealistically attractive. The accuser, as he is called in the book of Revelation,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"6\"><\/sup><\/a> will tempt you with thoughts that sound like this: \u201cYou aren\u2019t strong enough to change your life; you can\u2019t do this; you don\u2019t belong with these people; they will never accept you; you are too weak.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189376\" id=\"p_dRNTQ\">If these thoughts seem to ring true to you who are newly planted on the covenant path, we plead with you not to heed the accuser\u2019s voice. We love you; you can do it; we accept you; and with the Savior, you will have strength to do all. At a time when you need our love and support the most, don\u2019t be deceived into thinking that we will reject you if you take a step back into your prior lifestyle. Through the matchless power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ, you can be made whole again. But if you hide from Him and distance yourself from your newfound faith community, you distance yourself from the very source that can and will give you the strength to overcome.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189379\" id=\"p_lTdN4\">A dear friend of mine, a recent convert, shared how difficult it is to sustain faith in isolation. There is great strength in becoming and remaining part of a supportive community\u2014all stumbling yet progressing while blessed by the love of Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189385\" id=\"p_vml0g\">President Russell M. Nelson has taught that \u201covercoming the world is not an event that happens in a day or two. It happens over a lifetime as we repeatedly embrace the doctrine of Christ. We cultivate faith in Jesus Christ by repenting daily and keeping covenants that endow us with power. We stay on the covenant path and are blessed with spiritual strength, personal revelation, increasing faith, and the ministering of angels.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"7\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189390\" id=\"p_hQQnE\">If you incur a physical injury, your condition will deteriorate and may become life-threatening if you don\u2019t seek proper medical attention. That is true for spiritual wounds as well. Only, untreated spiritual wounds may threaten your eternal salvation. Don\u2019t hide from those who will love and support you; rather, run to them. Good bishops, branch presidents, and leaders can help you access the healing power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189395\" id=\"p_fqUMV\">To those who may be in hiding, we implore you to come back. You need what the gospel and the Atonement of Jesus Christ offer, and we need what you offer. God knows your sins; you cannot hide from Him. Reconcile yourself before Him.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189401\" id=\"p_mchRm\">As His Saints, each of us must foster a culture of belonging in the Church that is loving, accepting, and encouraging of all who desire to progress along His path.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189405\" id=\"p_zR1Mm\">Beware this second temptation! Follow the counsel of prophets both ancient and modern and know that you cannot hide from a loving Father.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189409\" id=\"p_drLLG\">Instead, avail yourself of the miraculous healing power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ. This is the very purpose of our existence\u2014to obtain a weakened and mortal body that is \u201csubject to all manner of infirmities\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"8\"><\/sup><\/a> and that will succumb to, sadly, many first temptations; to progress even when we fall to these temptations; and to seek divine help after doing so, that we might become more like our Savior and our Father in Heaven.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"9\"><\/sup><\/a> It is His way. It is the only way. Of these truths I testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<\/div>\n<footer class=\"notes\">\n<p class=\"title\" data-aid=\"165189412\" id=\"p_qVQ25\">Notes<\/p>\n<ol class=\"decimal\" data-type=\"marker\" start=\"1\">\n<li data-marker=\"1.\" id=\"note1\" data-full-marker=\"1.\">\n<p data-aid=\"165189420\" id=\"p_yZhVV\">See <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/5?lang=eng&amp;id=p10-p11#p10\">Moses 5:10\u201311<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"2.\" id=\"note2\" data-full-marker=\"2.\">\n<p data-aid=\"165189422\" id=\"p_aEhzy\">See <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/pgp/moses/4?lang=eng&amp;id=p13-p17#p13\">Moses 4:13\u201317<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"3.\" id=\"note3\" data-full-marker=\"3.\">\n<p data-aid=\"165189430\" id=\"p_h5Z8R\"><a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/ot/jer/23?lang=eng&amp;id=p24#p24\">Jeremiah 23:24<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"4.\" id=\"note4\" data-full-marker=\"4.\">\n<p data-aid=\"165189434\" id=\"p_dSxh0\"><a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/ot/job/34?lang=eng&amp;id=p21-p22#p21\">Job 34:21\u201322<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"5.\" id=\"note5\" data-full-marker=\"5.\">\n<p data-aid=\"165189438\" id=\"p_qwXFI\"><a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/ot/ps/139?lang=eng&amp;id=p1-p2%2Cp4%2Cp7-p8#p1\">Psalm 139:1\u20132, 4, 7\u20138<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"6.\" id=\"note6\" data-full-marker=\"6.\">\n<p data-aid=\"165189442\" id=\"p_hx3Yi\">See <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/nt/rev/12?lang=eng&amp;id=p10#p10\">Revelation 12:10<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"7.\" id=\"note7\" data-full-marker=\"7.\">\n<p data-aid=\"165189447\" id=\"p_yuuuL\">Russell M.
