Shumway<\/p>\n<p class=\"author-role\" data-aid=\"165188811\" id=\"p_xeJKq\">Of the Seventy<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"kicker\" data-aid=\"165188817\" id=\"p_y4SPK\">Callings and other ways we embark in God\u2019s work uniquely prepare us to meet the Savior.<\/p>\n<\/header>\n<div class=\"body-block\">\n<p data-aid=\"165188823\" id=\"p_jfDqX\">A few months ago, I was standing in a hall when Elder Neil L. Andersen walked by. I had just been called as a new General Authority. Likely sensing my feelings of inadequacy, he smiled and said, \u201cWell, there looks like a man who has no idea what he is doing.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188829\" id=\"p_c8vCc\">And I thought, \u201cThere is a true prophet and seer.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188835\" id=\"p_mU7Eb\">Elder Andersen then whispered, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, Elder Shumway. It gets better\u2014in five or six years.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188841\" id=\"p_oXZog\">Have you ever wondered why we are asked to do things in God\u2019s kingdom that feel beyond our reach? With life\u2019s demands, have you asked why we even need callings in the Church? Well, I have.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188847\" id=\"p_rZbcG\">And I got an answer in general conference when President Russell M. Nelson said, \u201cNow is the time for you and for me to prepare for the Second Coming of our Lord and Savior, Jesus the Christ.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"1\"><\/sup><\/a> When President Nelson said this, the Spirit taught me that as we participate in God\u2019s work, we prepare ourselves and others for Christ\u2019s return. The Lord\u2019s promise is compelling that callings, ministering, temple worship, following promptings, and other ways we embark in God\u2019s work uniquely prepare us to meet the Savior.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"2\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<section id=\"sec_sHhwF\">\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"165188852\" id=\"p_uKb71\">God Is Pleased When We Engage in His Work<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"165188858\" id=\"p_z4jaT\">In \u201cthe majesty of this moment,\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"3\"><\/sup><\/a> as God\u2019s kingdom expands and temples dot the earth, there is a growing need for willing souls to engage in God\u2019s work. Selflessly serving is the very essence of Christlike discipleship. But serving is rarely convenient. This is why I admire you covenant-keeping disciples, including our dear missionaries, who set aside your desires and challenges to serve God by serving His children. God \u201cdelights to honor [you for serving Him] in righteousness.\u201d He promises, \u201cGreat shall be [your] reward and eternal shall be [your] glory.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"4\"><\/sup><\/a> When we say yes to serving, we are saying yes to Jesus Christ. And when we say yes to Christ, we are saying yes to the most abundant life possible.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"5\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188864\" id=\"p_veTGZ\">I learned this lesson while working and studying chemical engineering in college. I was asked to be the activities planner for a singles ward. This was my nightmare calling. Still, I accepted, and at first it was drudgery. Then at one activity a beautiful girl was smitten by the way I served the ice cream. She returned three times, hoping to catch my attention. We fell in love, and she proposed to me just two weeks later. Well, maybe it wasn\u2019t quite that fast, and I was the one who proposed, but the truth is this: I shudder to think of missing out on Heidi had I said no to that calling.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"sec_ireiu\">\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"165188870\" id=\"p_dPWtz\">Our Participation Is Preparation for Christ\u2019s Return<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"165188876\" id=\"p_ajTeY\">We engage in God\u2019s work not because God needs us but because we need God and His mighty blessings. He promises, \u201cFor, behold, I will bless all those who labor in my vineyard with a mighty blessing.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"6\"><\/sup><\/a> Let me share three principles that teach how our participation in God\u2019s work blesses and helps us prepare to meet the Savior.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188879\" id=\"p_dsz7y\">First, as we participate, we progress toward \u201cthe measure of [our] creation.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"7\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188885\" id=\"p_znAad\">We learn this pattern in the account of the Creation. After each day of labor, God acknowledged the progress made by saying, \u201cIt was good.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"8\"><\/sup><\/a> He did not say the work was finished nor that it was perfect. But what He did say was that there was progress, and in God\u2019s eyes, that is good!<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"9\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188892\" id=\"p_tC6YN\">Callings do not determine or validate a person\u2019s worth or worthiness. Rather, as we labor with God in whatever way He asks, we grow into the measure of our own creation.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"10\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188899\" id=\"p_fWocb\">God rejoices in our progress, and so should we, even when we still have work to do. At times we may lack the strength or the means to serve in a calling.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"11\"><\/sup><\/a> Still, we can engage in the work and protect our testimonies through meaningful ways like prayer and scripture study. Our loving Heavenly Father does not condemn us when we are willing but unable to serve.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"12\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188908\" id=\"p_yiaq8\">Second, serving elevates our homes and churches into holy places where we can practice covenant living.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188914\" id=\"p_zT5Rr\">For example, our covenant to always remember Christ is made individually, but this covenant is lived as we serve others.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"13\"><\/sup><\/a> Callings surround us with opportunities to \u201cbear \u2026 one another\u2019s burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note14\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"14\"><\/sup><\/a> When we serve because we love God and want to live our covenants, service that seems dutiful and draining becomes joyful and transformative.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note15\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"15\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188920\" id=\"p_xsGZh\">Ordinances don\u2019t save us because they fulfill a heavenly checklist. Rather, when we live the covenants connected with these ordinances, we become the kind of person who wants to be in God\u2019s presence. This understanding overcomes hesitations to serve or preferences not to serve. Our preparation to meet Jesus Christ accelerates when we stop asking what God will permit and start asking what God would prefer.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note16\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"16\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188926\" id=\"p_c1vqp\">Third, participating in God\u2019s work helps us receive God\u2019s gift of grace and feel His greater love.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188932\" id=\"p_lUayk\">We do not receive financial compensation for serving.
