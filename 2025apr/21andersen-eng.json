Through a series of beautiful events, the parents determined to return to the Savior and His Church. During the time they were distant from the Church, their teenage daughter was involved with a young man. Returning, this precious daughter felt immense love from her Heavenly Father during a Young Women testimony meeting. She determined to more fully live the commandments. She wrote, \u201cI began the repentance process with my bishop.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"2\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188483\" id=\"p_vclqX\">Soon after, she became ill.

Nelson said, \u201cA hallmark of the Lord\u2019s true and living Church will always be an organized \u2026 effort to minister to individual children of God \u2026 [ministering with loving-kindness] to the one, just as He did.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"4\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"sec_ujtes\">\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"165188493\" id=\"p_iYW9d\">Helping Righteous Choices<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"165188495\" id=\"p_dbuNV\">When a single woman discovers that she is expecting an unanticipated child, health concerns, spiritual turmoil, embarrassment, financial worries, educational questions, marriage uncertainty, and the sadness of shattered dreams can, in a moment of pain and bewilderment, lead a thoughtful woman to take steps that will bring deep pain and regret.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188498\" id=\"p_yuUFY\">For any listening who have experienced the deep pain and regret from having or participating in an abortion,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"5\"><\/sup><\/a> please remember: Although we cannot change the past, God can heal the past.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"6\"><\/sup><\/a> Forgiveness can come through the miracle of His atoning grace as you turn to Him with a humble and repentant heart.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"7\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188500\" id=\"p_uWO5R\">Two words are often attached to the sanctity of mortal birth: life and choice. Life is a most precious part of our Father\u2019s perfect plan, and by His decree we cherish and preserve life; and we choose the continuation of life once conceived. We also treasure the gift of choice, of moral agency\u2014helping to strengthen righteous choices approved by God that bring eternal happiness.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"8\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188502\" id=\"p_if9jO\">When a woman and a man are in such a fragile time, facing a crucial choice, our words, our hands, our hearts\u2014spiritually, emotionally, and financially\u2014can bless them to feel the Savior\u2019s love and, as President Henry B. Eyring has said, bring a clarifying adjustment to their spiritual eyes from \u201cwhat they think they see\u201d to \u201cwhat they cannot yet see.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"9\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"sec_u5XEH\">\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"165188504\" id=\"p_lTD6J\">The Doctrine of Mortal Life<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"165188506\" id=\"p_xfJFG\">President Dallin H.
