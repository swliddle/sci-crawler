Her features radiate faith and sacrifice. She says, \u201c<i>Todos mis hijos están aquí en el templo hoy<\/i>\u201d\u2014\u201cAll my children are here in the temple today.\u201d Generations gathered in the house of the Lord bring tears of joy and gratitude.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165190402\" id=\"p_fTR2o\">In cruel civil war, families and neighbors did unspeakable things to each other.

She is 70 years old, as is he. A beautiful bride, she has worthily waited for this day. She shyly swishes her bridal dress this way, then that way. We shed joyful tears. God\u2019s promises are fulfilled. His covenants bring blessings.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165190424\" id=\"p_ljXCM\">While home teaching a widowed sister, a young Boyd K. Packer learned a tender lesson. Following a disagreement with her husband, the sister had called out a final hurtful remark. An unexpected accident took her husband\u2019s life that day. \u201cFor fifty years,\u201d the widow sobbed, \u201cI\u2019ve lived in hell knowing that the last words he heard from my lips were that biting, spiteful remark.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"11\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165190435\" id=\"p_a4kdc\">Easter in Jesus Christ helps us mend, reconcile, make right our relationships, on both sides of the veil. Jesus can heal grief; He can enable forgiveness. He can free us and others from things we or they have said or done that otherwise bind us captive.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165190446\" id=\"p_lBSZV\">Easter in Jesus Christ lets us feel God\u2019s approbation. This world tells us we are too tall, too short, too wide, too narrow\u2014not smart, pretty, or spiritual enough. Through spiritual transformation in Jesus Christ, we can escape debilitating perfectionism.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165190457\" id=\"p_nCQg0\">With Easter joy, we sing, \u201cDeath is conquered; man is free.

Jesus Christ\u2019s Atonement also restores us spiritually. He bled from every pore, weeping blood as it were, to provide us escape from sin and separation. He reunites us, whole and holy, with each other and God. In all good things, Jesus Christ restores abundantly\u2014not only what was but also what can be.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165190468\" id=\"p_rQ7Qy\">Jesus\u2019s life and light testify of God\u2019s love for all His children. Because God our Father loves all His children in every age and land, we find His loving invitation to come find peace and joy in Him in many traditions and cultures. Wherever, whenever, whoever we are, we share divine identity as children of the same Creator. In similar spirit, followers of Islam, Judaism, and Christianity share religious heritage in Father Abraham and covenant connection through events in ancient Egypt.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165190479\" id=\"p_pxkDo\">Father Abraham came to Egypt and was blessed.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165190489\" id=\"p_crg8f\">Joseph, sold into servitude in Egypt, knew Pharaoh\u2019s dream meant seven years of plenty followed by seven years of famine.
