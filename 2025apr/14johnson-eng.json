Wholeness is born of faith in and conversion to Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n<\/header>\n<div class=\"body-block\">\n<p data-aid=\"165187852\" id=\"p_nOi5i\">Ten lepers hollered to the Savior, \u201cHave mercy on us.\u201d And Jesus did. He told them to show themselves to the priest, and as they went, they were cleansed of the disease.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187856\" id=\"p_sRbN6\">And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, shouted praises to God. He returned to the Savior, fell at His feet, and expressed gratitude.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187860\" id=\"p_tmSf0\">And the Savior said to him who was thankful, \u201cThy faith hath made thee whole.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"1\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187865\" id=\"p_yHxRB\">Jesus Christ had healed ten lepers. But one, coming back to the Savior, received something in addition. He was made whole.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187869\" id=\"p_l02Ud\">Nine lepers were physically healed.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187873\" id=\"p_ypvh4\">One was physically healed <em>and<\/em> made spiritually whole.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187877\" id=\"p_dRzpc\">In pondering this story, I have wondered if the converse is true. If healing and wholeness are not the same, can one be made spiritually whole by Him but not yet physically and emotionally healed?<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187881\" id=\"p_k4Dxb\">The Master Healer will heal all our afflictions\u2014physical and emotional\u2014in His time.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"2\"><\/sup><\/a> But in the waiting to be healed, can one be whole?<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187885\" id=\"p_cBGMS\">What might it mean to be spiritually whole?<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187891\" id=\"p_o3mDd\">We are whole in Jesus Christ when we exercise our agency to follow Him in faith, submit our hearts to Him so He can change them, keep His commandments, and enter a covenant relationship with Him, meekly enduring and learning from the challenges of this earthly estate until we return to His presence and are healed in every way. I can be whole while I wait for healing if I am wholehearted in my relationship with Him.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187896\" id=\"p_r0lXj\">Faith in Jesus Christ begets hope. I find hope in striving to be whole\u2014a wholeness born of faith in Jesus Christ. Faith in Him increases my hope for healing, and that hope reinforces my faith in Jesus Christ. It is a powerful cycle.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"3\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187901\" id=\"p_knTha\">The Lord told Enos his faith had made him \u201cwhole.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"4\"><\/sup><\/a> Wholeness came as Enos pondered on the words of his prophet-father, Jacob, as he hungered to understand the opportunity for eternal life, as he cried unto God in mighty prayer. And in that state of desire and humility, the voice of the Lord came to him, announcing his sins were forgiven. And Enos asked the Lord, \u201cHow is it done?\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"5\"><\/sup><\/a> And the Lord responded, \u201cBecause of thy faith in Christ, \u2026 thy faith hath made thee whole.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"6\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187906\" id=\"p_tcQcO\">Through our faith in Jesus Christ, we can seek to be spiritually whole while we wait and hope for physical and emotional healing.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165187911\" id=\"p_dRR0E\">By virtue of His atoning sacrifice, and when we sincerely repent, the Savior heals us from sin, as He did with Enos.

The foolish virgins took their lamps of testimony but took no oil with them. Consider the oil to be the oil of conversion. \u2026<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165190266\" id=\"p_t07PE\">\u201cWere the five wise virgins selfish and unwilling to share, or were they indicating correctly that the oil of conversion cannot be borrowed? Can the spiritual strength that results from consistent obedience to the commandments be given to another person? Can the knowledge obtained through diligent study and pondering of the scriptures be conveyed to one who is in need? Can the peace the gospel brings to a faithful Latter-day Saint be transferred to an individual experiencing adversity or great challenge? The clear answer to each of these questions is no.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165190279\" id=\"p_nmzoI\">He went on to explain that we have an \u201cindividual responsibility to keep our lamp of testimony burning and to obtain an ample supply of the oil of conversion.
