His instructions are neither mysterious nor complex. When we follow them, we do not need to fear or be anxious.<\/p>\n<\/header>\n<div class=\"body-block\">\n<p data-aid=\"165188635\" id=\"p_dYgDU\">My dear brothers and sisters, last October, President Russell M. Nelson taught, \u201cNow is the time for you and for me to prepare for the Second Coming of our Lord and Savior, Jesus the Christ.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"1\"><\/sup><\/a> When President Nelson speaks about the Second Coming, it is always with joyful optimism. However, a girl in Primary recently told me that she becomes anxious whenever the Second Coming is mentioned. She said, \u201cI\u2019m scared because bad things are going to happen before Jesus comes again.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188639\" id=\"p_c6LgR\">It is not just children who may feel this way. The best advice for her, for you, and for me is to follow the Savior\u2019s teachings. His instructions are neither mysterious nor complex. When we follow them, we do not need to fear or be anxious.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"2\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188642\" id=\"p_fEW7v\">Toward the end of His mortal ministry, Jesus Christ was asked when He would come again. In answering, He taught three parables, recorded in <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/nt/matt/25?lang=eng\">Matthew 25<\/a>, about how to prepare to meet Him\u2014whether at His Second Coming or whenever we leave this world.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"3\"><\/sup><\/a> These teachings are crucial because personal preparation to meet Him is central to life\u2019s purpose.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"4\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188643\" id=\"p_hOjzm\">The Savior first told the parable of the ten virgins. In this parable, ten virgins went to a wedding feast. Five wisely brought oil to fill their lamps, and five foolishly did not. When the bridegroom\u2019s imminent arrival was announced, the foolish virgins left to buy oil. When they returned, it was too late; the door to the feast was shut.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"5\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188647\" id=\"p_jUj7o\">Jesus identified three aspects of the parable to help us. He explained:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188650\" id=\"p_vbxXw\">\u201cAnd at that day, when I shall come in my glory, shall the parable be fulfilled which I spake concerning the ten virgins.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188654\" id=\"p_sPG8B\">\u201cFor they that are wise and have received the truth, and have taken the Holy Spirit for their guide, and have not been deceived\u2014verily I say unto you, they shall \u2026 abide the day.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"6\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188657\" id=\"p_qP6hl\">In other words, they did not need to fear or be anxious, because they would survive and prosper. They would prevail.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188660\" id=\"p_izngu\">If we are wise, we receive the truth by accepting the gospel of Jesus Christ through priesthood ordinances and covenants. Next, we strive to remain worthy of having the Holy Ghost always with us. This capability must be acquired individually and personally, drop by drop.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"7\"><\/sup><\/a> Consistent, personal, private acts of devotion invite the Holy Ghost to guide us.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"8\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188662\" id=\"p_ypzAo\">The third element that Jesus highlighted is avoiding deception. The Savior warned:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188664\" id=\"p_vEQsL\">\u201cTake heed that no man deceive you.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188667\" id=\"p_jBxrl\">\u201cFor many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and shall deceive many.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"9\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188669\" id=\"p_qItQr\">The Savior knew pretenders would try to deceive the very elect and that many disciples would be duped.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"10\"><\/sup><\/a> We should neither believe those who falsely claim divine sanction nor venture into metaphorical deserts or secret chambers to be taught by counterfeits.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188671\" id=\"p_x7gIZ\">The Book of Mormon teaches us how we can differentiate deceivers from disciples. Disciples always promote believing in God, serving Him, and doing good.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"11\"><\/sup><\/a> We will not be deceived when we seek and take counsel from trusted individuals who are themselves faithful disciples of the Savior.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"12\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188673\" id=\"p_nwlrw\">We can also avoid deception by worshipping regularly in the temple. This helps us maintain an eternal perspective and protects us from influences that might distract or divert us from the covenant path.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"13\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188675\" id=\"p_xJflF\">The essential lesson of this parable of the ten virgins is that we are wise when we accept the gospel, seek to have the Holy Ghost with us, and avoid deception. The five wise virgins could not help those without oil; no one can accept the gospel, take the Holy Ghost as a guide, and avoid deception on our behalf.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note14\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"14\"><\/sup><\/a> We have to do this for ourselves.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188676\" id=\"p_tTOH3\">The Savior then told the parable of the talents.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note15\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"15\"><\/sup><\/a> In this parable, a man gave differing amounts of money, referred to as talents,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note16\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"16\"><\/sup><\/a> to three servants. To one servant he gave five talents, to another he gave two, and to a third he gave one. Over time, the first two servants doubled what they had received. But the third servant simply buried his single talent. To both servants who had doubled their talents, the man said, \u201cWell done, \u2026 good and faithful servant: thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy lord.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note17\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"17\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188679\" id=\"p_lI7zA\">The man then chided the servant who had buried his talent for being \u201cwicked and slothful.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note18\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"18\"><\/sup><\/a> This servant\u2019s talent was taken away, and he was banished.

Consider this insight provided by the 18th-century Hasidic scholar Zusya of Anipol. Zusya was a renowned teacher who began to fear as he approached death. His disciples asked, \u201cMaster, why do you tremble? You\u2019ve lived a good life; surely God will grant you a great reward.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188682\" id=\"p_hZVIz\">Zusya said: \u201cIf God says to me, \u2018Zusya, why were you not another Moses?\u2019 I will say, \u2018Because you didn\u2019t give me the greatness of soul that you gave Moses.\u2019 And if I stand before God and He says, \u2018Zusya, why were you not another Solomon?\u2019 I will say, \u2018Because you didn\u2019t give me the wisdom of Solomon.\u2019 But, alas, what will I say if I stand before my Maker and He says, \u2018Zusya, why were you not Zusya?

With His loving assistance, He expects us to become the best version of ourselves. That we may start with differing abilities is irrelevant to Him. And it should be to us.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note22\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"22\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188687\" id=\"p_kmhjl\">Finally, the Savior told the parable of the sheep and goats.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note23\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"23\"><\/sup><\/a> When He returns in His glory, \u201cbefore him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth his sheep from the goats: and he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note24\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"24\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188688\" id=\"p_jfCRe\">Those on His right became heirs in His kingdom, and those on His left received no inheritance.

He expects us to use our gifts, talents, and abilities to bless the lives of Heavenly Father\u2019s children. The divine impulse to serve others is illustrated in a poem written in the 19th century by the Finnish poet Johan Ludvig Runeberg. My siblings and I repeatedly heard the poem \u201cFarmer Paavo\u201d throughout our childhoods. In the poem, Paavo was a poor farmer who lived with his wife and children in the lake region of central Finland. Several years in a row, most of his crops were destroyed, whether through the runoff from the spring snowmelt, summer hailstorms, or an early autumn frost. Each time the meager harvest came in, the farmer\u2019s wife lamented, \u201cPaavo, Paavo, you unfortunate old man, God has forsaken us.\u201d Paavo, in turn, stoically said, \u201cMix bark with the rye flour to make bread so the children won\u2019t go hungry.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note28\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"28\"><\/sup><\/a> I\u2019ll work harder to drain the marshy fields. God is testing us, but He will provide.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188691\" id=\"p_qWRkN\">Each time the crops were destroyed, Paavo directed his wife to double the amount of bark that she mixed into the flour to ward off starvation. He also worked harder, digging trenches to drain the ground and decrease his fields\u2019 susceptibility to a spring runoff and an early autumn frost.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188692\" id=\"p_bJEJc\">After years of hardship, Paavo finally harvested a rich crop. His wife exulted, \u201cPaavo, Paavo, these are happy times! It is time to throw away the bark, and bake bread made only with rye.\u201d But Paavo solemnly took his wife\u2019s hand and said, \u201cMix half the flour with bark, for our neighbor\u2019s fields have frosted over.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note29\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"29\"><\/sup><\/a> Paavo sacrificed his and his family\u2019s bounty to help his devastated and destitute neighbor.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188694\" id=\"p_oUIWf\">The lesson of the Savior\u2019s parable of the sheep and goats is that we are to use the gifts we have been given\u2014time, talents, and blessings\u2014to serve Heavenly Father\u2019s children, especially the most vulnerable and needy.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note30\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"30\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188696\" id=\"p_nuwhN\">My invitation to the anxious Primary child I mentioned earlier, and to each of you, is to follow Jesus Christ and to trust the Holy Ghost as you would a cherished friend.

But there are many who, not having reached this point of determined conviction, are driven about by every wind of doctrine, thus being ill at ease, unsettled, restless. These are they who are discouraged over incidents that occur in the Church, and in the nation, and in the turmoils of men. \u2026 They harbor a feeling of suspicion, unrest, uncertainty. Their thoughts are disturbed, and they become excited with the least change, like one at sea who has lost his bearings\u201d (<cite>Gospel Doctrine<\/cite>, 5th ed.

But there are many who, not having reached this point of determined conviction, are driven about by every wind of doctrine, thus being ill at ease, unsettled, restless. These are they who are discouraged over incidents that occur in the Church, and in the nation, and in the turmoils of men. \u2026 They harbor a feeling of suspicion, unrest, uncertainty. Their thoughts are disturbed, and they become excited with the least change, like one at sea who has lost his bearings\u201d (<cite>Gospel Doctrine<\/cite>, 5th ed. [1939], 126).<\/p>",
