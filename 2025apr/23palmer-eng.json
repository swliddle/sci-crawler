One sad night a mighty storm blew, and the willow came crashing down. It lay on the ground with its roots pulled out and was a sorry sight.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188557\" id=\"p_v53I2\">I was ready to rev up the chainsaw and cut the tree up for firewood when our neighbour came running out to stop me. He chastised me for giving up on the tree, and he emphatically urged us not to get rid of it. He then pointed to one root still in the ground and said that if we propped the tree up, cut off its branches, and nourished it, the roots would take hold once again.<\/p>\n<img alt=\"Fallen willow tree.\" id=\"img_f2qFH\" src=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/rvgx4f2ibyipwo7nzujn7yrt0spb1rql5znohyhc/full/%21500%2C/0/default\" data-img-id=\"rvgx4f2ibyipwo7nzujn7yrt0spb1rql5znohyhc\" srcset=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/rvgx4f2ibyipwo7nzujn7yrt0spb1rql5znohyhc/full/%2160%2C/0/default 60w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/rvgx4f2ibyipwo7nzujn7yrt0spb1rql5znohyhc/full/%21100%2C/0/default 100w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/rvgx4f2ibyipwo7nzujn7yrt0spb1rql5znohyhc/full/%21200%2C/0/default 200w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/rvgx4f2ibyipwo7nzujn7yrt0spb1rql5znohyhc/full/%21250%2C/0/default 250w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/rvgx4f2ibyipwo7nzujn7yrt0spb1rql5znohyhc/full/%21320%2C/0/default 320w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/rvgx4f2ibyipwo7nzujn7yrt0spb1rql5znohyhc/full/%21500%2C/0/default 500w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/rvgx4f2ibyipwo7nzujn7yrt0spb1rql5znohyhc/full/%21640%2C/0/default 640w\" data-assetId=\"rvgx4f2ibyipwo7nzujn7yrt0spb1rql5znohyhc\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"281\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.7793594306049823\" data-public-title=\"Fallen willow tree with exposed roots\" data-public-description=\"Fallen willow tree with exposed roots\"/>\n<img alt=\"One tree root remaining in the ground.\" id=\"img_mgpHg\" src=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/q41q9n0xunlcgt1djk8nbyhg4ppw5lbo295gulrn/full/%21500%2C/0/default\" data-img-id=\"q41q9n0xunlcgt1djk8nbyhg4ppw5lbo295gulrn\" srcset=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/q41q9n0xunlcgt1djk8nbyhg4ppw5lbo295gulrn/full/%2160%2C/0/default 60w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/q41q9n0xunlcgt1djk8nbyhg4ppw5lbo295gulrn/full/%21100%2C/0/default 100w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/q41q9n0xunlcgt1djk8nbyhg4ppw5lbo295gulrn/full/%21200%2C/0/default 200w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/q41q9n0xunlcgt1djk8nbyhg4ppw5lbo295gulrn/full/%21250%2C/0/default 250w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/q41q9n0xunlcgt1djk8nbyhg4ppw5lbo295gulrn/full/%21320%2C/0/default 320w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/q41q9n0xunlcgt1djk8nbyhg4ppw5lbo295gulrn/full/%21500%2C/0/default 500w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/q41q9n0xunlcgt1djk8nbyhg4ppw5lbo295gulrn/full/%21640%2C/0/default 640w\" data-assetId=\"q41q9n0xunlcgt1djk8nbyhg4ppw5lbo295gulrn\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"281\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.7793594306049823\" data-public-title=\"Exposed roots of fallen tree\" data-public-description=\"Exposed roots of fallen tree\"/>\n<p data-aid=\"165188561\" id=\"p_jLXPI\">I was sceptical and doubted how a tree so obviously fallen and in trouble could possibly survive and come back to life. I reasoned that even if it did begin growing again, it would surely not survive the next storm.

Some once had testimonies of the gospel that were strong and vibrant like the willow. Then, for uniquely personal reasons, those testimonies became weakened, leading to a loss of faith. Others hang on with the slimmest of roots tapping into gospel soil.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188570\" id=\"p_oOtN7\">Yet again and again, I am inspired by the stories of so many who have chosen to renew their discipleship and come back to their Church home. Rather than discarding their faith and belief like worthless firewood, instead they have responded to spiritual promptings and loving invitations to return.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188573\" id=\"p_vy6QG\">I attended a stake conference in Korea where a returning member shared: \u201cI thank the brothers for their willingness to accept my lack of faith and my weakness, for reaching out to me, and for the members who are always so kind to me. I still have a lot of friends around me who are less active. It\u2019s funny, but they tell each other to go back to the Church to get their faith back. I think maybe they are all <em>longing for faith<\/em>.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188575\" id=\"p_u4xgy\">To all who are longing for faith, we invite you to come back. I promise your faith can be strengthened as you once again worship with the Saints.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188577\" id=\"p_k6Nw3\">A former missionary from Africa wrote a senior Church leader, apologising and seeking forgiveness for being offended by his teachings about a certain cultural tradition, which then led him to leave the Church. He humbly expressed: \u201cSadly, the fact that I took offense 15 years ago has made me pay an extremely heavy price. <em>I lost so much<\/em>\u2014much more than I ever imagined. I am deeply embarrassed by the harm I may have caused along the way, but above all else I am pleased that I have found my way back.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188580\" id=\"p_p9lxU\">To all who recognise what you have lost, we invite you to come back so you can once again taste the joyous fruit of the gospel.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188584\" id=\"p_ein3n\">A sister in the United States was gone from the Church for many years. Her story of coming back includes powerful lessons for parents and family members who anguish over loved ones who step away. She wrote:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188586\" id=\"p_tQw3G\">\u201cI could list a myriad of reasons for why I walked away from the Church, the gospel, and in a way, my family. But they really don\u2019t matter. I didn\u2019t make one big decision to leave the Church\u2014I probably made a thousand choices. But one thing I have always known is that my parents did make one big decision, and they stuck to it. They decided to love me.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188589\" id=\"p_iwRyH\">\u201cI couldn\u2019t possibly know how many tears have been shed, how many sleepless nights, nor how many heartfelt pleading words of prayer have been uttered on my behalf. They didn\u2019t call me out on my sins; rather, they called out to me in my sinfulness. They didn\u2019t make me feel unwelcome in their home and at family gatherings; any of those feelings were of my own doing. Instead, they continued to welcome me. They must have seen my light dim over time. But they knew that the person I was back then was just a shadow of who I was yet to become.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188591\" id=\"p_kOjQD\">\u201cJust as my path away from the Church was complex, so was my way back. But one thing that was not hard about coming back was the feeling of being back home where I belong.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188595\" id=\"p_qZZ3t\">My message today is especially to all who once felt the Spirit but question whether there is a way back or a place for you in the restored Church of Jesus Christ. It is also for any who are barely hanging on or who are tempted to step away.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188596\" id=\"p_eorpZ\">This message is not a challenge, and it is not a condemnation. It is an invitation, extended with love and a sincere desire to welcome you back to your spiritual home.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188600\" id=\"p_xKkb7\">I have prayed that you will feel the witness of the Holy Ghost as you now hear this loving invitation and magnificent promise from our Saviour, Jesus Christ:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188604\" id=\"p_djmEB\"><em>\u201cWill ye not now return unto me<\/em>,<em> and repent of your sins<\/em>,<em> and be converted, that I may heal you?\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"2\"><\/sup><\/a><\/em><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188605\" id=\"p_c2Q1A\">Every week many are responding to the Saviour\u2019s invitation by returning to discipleship and Church activity, quietly and humbly seeking the healing that Jesus promises.
