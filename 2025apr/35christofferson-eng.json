As I have considered the matter of worshipping our Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son, our Savior, four concepts have come to mind: <em>first<\/em>, the actions that constitute our worship; <em>second<\/em>, the attitudes and feelings that figure into our worship; <em>third<\/em>, the exclusivity of our worship; and <em>fourth<\/em>, the need to emulate the Holy Beings that we worship.<\/p>\n<section id=\"sec_rZtyC\">\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"165188822\" id=\"p_qWvAd\">First, the Actions That Constitute Our Worship<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"165188828\" id=\"p_tvPiF\">One of the most common and important forms of worship is to gather in a consecrated space to perform acts of devotion. The Lord says, \u201cAnd that thou mayest more fully keep thyself unspotted from the world, thou shalt go to the house of prayer and offer up thy sacraments upon my holy day.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"3\"><\/sup><\/a> This is, of course, our primary motivation in building chapels. But, if necessary, a non-dedicated space will do if we can invest it with some degree of sanctity.<\/p>\n<img alt=\"Sacrament meeting.\" id=\"img_tAq5h\" src=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/7u7x0xionj70rvketdorup0uc0kvucar32mgi49f/full/%21500%2C/0/default\" data-img-id=\"7u7x0xionj70rvketdorup0uc0kvucar32mgi49f\" srcset=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/7u7x0xionj70rvketdorup0uc0kvucar32mgi49f/full/%2160%2C/0/default 60w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/7u7x0xionj70rvketdorup0uc0kvucar32mgi49f/full/%21100%2C/0/default 100w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/7u7x0xionj70rvketdorup0uc0kvucar32mgi49f/full/%21200%2C/0/default 200w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/7u7x0xionj70rvketdorup0uc0kvucar32mgi49f/full/%21250%2C/0/default 250w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/7u7x0xionj70rvketdorup0uc0kvucar32mgi49f/full/%21320%2C/0/default 320w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/7u7x0xionj70rvketdorup0uc0kvucar32mgi49f/full/%21500%2C/0/default 500w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/7u7x0xionj70rvketdorup0uc0kvucar32mgi49f/full/%21640%2C/0/default 640w\" data-assetId=\"7u7x0xionj70rvketdorup0uc0kvucar32mgi49f\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"281\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.7793594306049823\" data-public-title=\"Sacrament Meeting\" data-public-description=\"Members singing in a sacrament meeting in Ghana, Africa.\"/>\n<p data-aid=\"165188834\" id=\"p_z4RbN\">Most important is what we do when we gather on the Lord\u2019s day. Of course, we dress as best we can according to our means\u2014not extravagantly but modestly in a way to signal our respect and reverence for Deity. Our conduct is similarly reverent and respectful. We worship by joining in prayer; we worship by singing hymns (not just listening to but singing the hymns); we worship by instructing and learning from one another. Jesus says, \u201cRemember that on this, the Lord\u2019s day, thou shalt offer thine oblations [meaning thine \u2018offerings \u2026 of time, talents, or means, in service of God and fellowman\u2019<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"4\"><\/sup><\/a>] and thy sacraments unto the Most High, confessing thy sins unto thy brethren, and before the Lord.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"5\"><\/sup><\/a> We come together not to entertain or be entertained\u2014as by a band, for instance\u2014but to remember Him and be \u201cinstructed more perfectly\u201d in His gospel.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"6\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188840\" id=\"p_zsAZk\">At the most recent general conference, Elder Patrick Kearon reminded us that \u201cwe do not gather on the Sabbath simply to attend sacrament meeting and check it off the list. We come together to worship. There is a significant difference between the two. To <em>attend<\/em> means to be present at. But to <em>worship<\/em> is to intentionally praise and adore our God in a way that transforms us!\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"7\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188845\" id=\"p_jQxgz\">Devoting our Sabbaths to the Lord and His purposes is itself an act of worship. Some years ago, then-Elder Russell M. Nelson observed: \u201cHow do we <em>hallow<\/em> the Sabbath day? In my much younger years, I studied the work of others who had compiled lists of things to do and things <em>not<\/em> to do on the Sabbath. It wasn\u2019t until later that I learned from the scriptures that my conduct and my attitude on the Sabbath constituted a <em>sign<\/em> between me and my Heavenly Father [see <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/ot/ex/31?lang=eng&amp;id=p13#p13\">Exodus 31:13<\/a>; <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/ot/ezek/20?lang=eng&amp;id=p12%2Cp20#p12\">Ezekiel 20:12, 20<\/a>]. With that understanding, I no longer needed lists of dos and don\u2019ts. When I had to make a decision whether or not an activity was appropriate for the Sabbath, I simply asked myself, \u2018What <em>sign<\/em> do I want to give to God?\u2019\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"8\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188851\" id=\"p_irgGi\">Worship on the Lord\u2019s day is marked by a particular focus on the great atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ. We appropriately and specially celebrate His Resurrection at Easter but also <em>every<\/em> week as we partake of the sacramental emblems of His Atonement, including His Resurrection. For the penitent, partaking of the sacrament is the highlight of Sabbath worship.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188856\" id=\"p_k8zQd\">Worshipping together as \u201cthe body of Christ\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"9\"><\/sup><\/a> has unique power and benefits as we teach, serve, and sustain one another.

Those who reject God as the source of truth, or disavow any accountability to Him, in effect substitute <em>themselves<\/em> as their god. One who places loyalty to a party or cause ahead of divine direction worships a false god.

Showing our devotion means emulating the Father and the Son\u2014cultivating Their attributes and character in ourselves. If, as the saying goes, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then we might say with respect to Deity, emulation is the sincerest form of veneration. This suggests an active, sustained effort on our part to seek holiness. But becoming more Christlike is also the natural outcome of our acts of worship. Elder Kearon\u2019s phrase cited earlier about worshipping \u201cin a way that transforms us\u201d is significant. True worship is transformative.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188996\" id=\"p_oBzA3\">This is the beauty of the covenant path\u2014the path of worship, love, and loyalty to God. We enter that path by baptism, pledging to take upon us the name of Christ and to keep His commandments. We receive the gift of the Holy Ghost, the messenger of the Savior\u2019s grace that redeems and cleanses us from sin as we repent.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note25\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"25\"><\/sup><\/a> We could even say that in repenting we are worshipping Him.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189002\" id=\"p_h3amr\">There follow additional priesthood ordinances and covenants made in the house of the Lord that further sanctify us. The ceremonies and ordinances of the temple constitute an elevated form of worship.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189006\" id=\"p_tmAR4\">President Russell M. Nelson has emphasized that \u201cevery man and every woman who participates in priesthood ordinances and who makes and keeps covenants with God has direct access to the power of God.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note26\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"26\"><\/sup><\/a> This is not only a power we draw upon to serve and to bless.
