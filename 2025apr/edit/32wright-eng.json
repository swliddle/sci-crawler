One day a sitting judge from the Utah Second District Court visited, put his official robes on Eli, and then administered an oath of office for their class. This ignited in Eli\u2019s young, impressionable soul a passion for studying law and the Lawgiver Himself, Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188730\" id=\"p_dCE3P\">After years of diligent effort, Eli received an invitation for an interview with one of his top choices for law school. He pronounced, \u201cMom, I was asked 10 questions. The final question was, \u2018Where do you derive your moral compass?\u2019 I stated that throughout history humankind has derived systems of morality by patterning their lives from archetypes. The archetype of morality I strive to pattern my life from is that of Jesus Christ. I stated if all of humanity abided by the teachings of Jesus Christ in the Sermon on the Mount, the world would be a better, more peaceful place.\u201d Then the interview ended, and he thought to himself, \u201cThere go my childhood dreams. No one in secular academia wants to hear about Jesus Christ.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188734\" id=\"p_sRvR9\">Two weeks later, Eli was admitted with a scholarship. Before committing, we visited the campus. The law school looked like a castle and was set high on a hill overlooking a beautiful lake. Remarkably, as we walked through the magnificent library and stately corridors, we found on banners and carved in stone attributes from the Sermon on the Mount.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188740\" id=\"p_g4lmq\">The Sermon on the Mount<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"1\"><\/sup><\/a> is decisively the most noteworthy discourse ever delivered,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"2\"><\/sup><\/a> pioneering in its teachings.

Absent a feeling of reverence, he will grow increasingly casual in attitude and lax in conduct. He will drift from the moorings that his covenants with God could provide. His feeling of accountability to God will diminish and then be forgotten. Thereafter, he will care only about his own comfort and satisfying his uncontrolled appetites. Finally, he will come to despise sacred things, even God, and then he will despise himself.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189177\" id=\"p_uYwId\">\u201cOn the other hand, with a sense of the sacred, one grows in understanding and truth.

Absent a feeling of reverence, he will grow increasingly casual in attitude and lax in conduct. He will drift from the moorings that his covenants with God could provide. His feeling of accountability to God will diminish and then be forgotten. Thereafter, he will care only about his own comfort and satisfying his uncontrolled appetites. Finally, he will come to despise sacred things, even God, and then he will despise himself.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165189177\" id=\"p_uYwId\">\u201cOn the other hand, with a sense of the sacred, one grows in understanding and truth.
