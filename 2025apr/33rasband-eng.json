Nelson invited us to study the dedicatory prayer of the Kirtland Temple, recorded in <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/109?lang=eng\">section 109 of the Doctrine and Covenants<\/a>.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"1\"><\/sup><\/a> The dedicatory prayer, said President Nelson, \u201cis a tutorial about how the temple spiritually empowers you and me to meet the challenges of life in these last days.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"2\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188150\" id=\"p_b9AFg\">I am sure your study of section 109 yielded insights that blessed you. This evening, I share a couple of things I learned as I followed our prophet\u2019s invitation. The peace-giving path down which my study led reminded me that the Lord is merciful and that our Heavenly Father\u2019s plan of salvation is truly a plan of mercy.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section id=\"sec_cck4h\">\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"165188160\" id=\"p_qe1Cy\">Newly Called Missionaries Serving in the Temple<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"165188170\" id=\"p_d2Qye\">As you may be aware, \u201cnewly called missionaries are encouraged to receive the temple endowment as soon as possible and to attend the temple as often as circumstances allow.\u201d Once endowed, they also \u201cmay serve as temple \u2026 workers before they begin missionary service.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"3\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188181\" id=\"p_yt3AF\">Time in the temple before entering the missionary training center (MTC) can be a wonderful blessing for new missionaries as they learn more about temple covenants before sharing the blessings of those covenants with the world.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188192\" id=\"p_zbo70\">But in studying section 109, I learned that in the temple, God empowers new missionaries\u2014indeed, all of us\u2014in an additional, sacred way.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"4\"><\/sup><\/a> In the dedicatory prayer, given by revelation, the Prophet Joseph Smith prayed that \u201cwhen thy servants shall go out from thy house \u2026 to bear testimony of thy name,\u201d the \u201chearts\u201d of \u201call people\u201d would \u201cbe softened\u201d\u2014both the \u201cgreat ones of the earth\u201d and \u201call the poor, the needy, and [the] afflicted.\u201d He prayed that \u201ctheir prejudices may give way before the truth, and thy people may obtain favor in the sight of all; that all the ends of the earth may know that we, thy servants, have heard thy voice, and that thou hast sent us.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"5\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188203\" id=\"p_mmifF\">This is a beautiful promise for a newly called missionary\u2014to have prejudices \u201cgive way before the truth,\u201d to \u201cobtain favor in the sight of all,\u201d and to have the world know they are sent by the Lord. Each of us surely needs these same blessings. What a blessing it would be to have hearts softened as we interact with neighbors and coworkers.

Nephi concludes the very first chapter of the Book of Mormon by saying, \u201cBehold, I, Nephi, will show unto you that the tender mercies of the Lord are over all those whom he hath chosen, because of their faith, to make them mighty even unto the power of deliverance\u201d (<a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/1?lang=eng&amp;id=p20#p20\">1 Nephi 1:20<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165190669\" id=\"p_lwBIR\">In <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/ot/ex/34?lang=eng&amp;id=p6#p6\">Exodus 34:6<\/a>, the Lord proclaims His name to Moses as \u201cThe Lord God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth.\u201d Some have suggested that this verse may be referenced by Old Testament prophets more than any other verse in the Old Testament (see, for example, Bible Project, \u201cThe Most Quoted Verse in the Bible,\u201d bibleproject.com/podcast/most-quoted-verse-bible/).<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165190676\" id=\"p_ncCl5\">In the New Testament, in the book of Luke, recall that Zacharias was struck \u201cdumb, and not able to speak\u201d when he doubted the angel\u2019s promise that Elisabeth in her old age would bear a son, who would be John the Baptist (<a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/nt/luke/1?lang=eng&amp;id=p20#p20\">Luke 1:20<\/a>). When Zacharias\u2019s voice was finally loosed, he was \u201cfilled with the Holy Ghost,\u201d and in the first public declaration that the time for the Messiah had finally arrived, he prophesied that the Lord would come \u201cto perform <em>the mercy<\/em> promised to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant; the oath which he sware to our father Abraham\u201d (<a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/nt/luke/1?lang=eng&amp;id=p67%2Cp72-p73#p67\">Luke 1:67, 72\u201373<\/a>; emphasis added).<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"20.\" id=\"note20\" data-full-marker=\"20.\">\n<p data-aid=\"165190683\" id=\"p_ppPi8\">Gospel Topics Essays, \u201c<a class=\"cross-ref\" href=\"/study/manual/gospel-topics-essays/first-vision-accounts?lang=eng&amp;id=p5#p5\">First Vision Accounts<\/a>,\u201d Gospel Library; see especially <a class=\"cross-ref\" href=\"/study/manual/first-vision-accounts/1832-account?lang=eng\">the 1832 account<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"21.\" id=\"note21\" data-full-marker=\"21.\">\n<p data-aid=\"165190690\" id=\"p_vQ7Mr\"><a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1?lang=eng&amp;id=p29#p29\">Joseph Smith\u2014History 1:29<\/a>. <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20?lang=eng&amp;id=p5-p6#p5\">Doctrine and Covenants 20:5\u20136<\/a> provides another description of the role of repentance in these two powerful visions.

As we consider how merciful the Lord has been, we may be tempted to disconnect mercy from justice\u2014to think that our Heavenly Father\u2019s loving mercy alone can overcome justice. But as Alma taught, \u201cThe plan of mercy <em>could not be brought about<\/em> except an atonement should be made; therefore God himself atoneth for the sins of the world, to bring about the plan of mercy, to appease the demands of justice, that God might be a perfect, just God, and a merciful God also\u201d (<a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/42?lang=eng&amp;id=p15#p15\">Alma 42:15<\/a>; emphasis added).<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165190743\" id=\"p_gB29M\">All the Savior\u2019s merciful love for us could not save us. Rather, it was His suffering the very real and painful demands of justice that saves us. This does not, of course, diminish the importance of His love. Surely it was His love for us\u2014and His desire to do the will of the Father, who also loves us\u2014that caused Him to be willing to suffer (see <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/nt/john/3?lang=eng&amp;id=p16#p16\">John 3:16<\/a>; <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/34?lang=eng&amp;id=p3#p3\">Doctrine and Covenants 34:3<\/a>). But love alone could not work.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165190747\" id=\"p_nFMVN\">Sometimes we may focus so much on His love for us just the way we are that we lose sight of the fact that the way we are\u2014as natural men and women whose behavior inevitably falls short of living the commandments\u2014demands that justice be satisfied. If we misunderstand and view His love as doing away with the demands of justice, we diminish the gift of His atoning sacrifice and the suffering He did to pay the terrible price of justice. It would be discouragingly ironic if His love for us were understood to make unnecessary His atoning sacrifice. How much better it is to look squarely at the full demands of justice and to then be grateful that He loved us enough to bear those very real demands on our behalf.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"31.\" id=\"note31\" data-full-marker=\"31.\">\n<p data-aid=\"165190751\" id=\"p_r22Kb\"><a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/7?lang=eng&amp;id=p11-p12#p11\">Alma 7:11\u201312<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"32.\" id=\"note32\" data-full-marker=\"32.\">\n<p data-aid=\"165190755\" id=\"p_zGNuc\"><a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/3?lang=eng&amp;id=p11#p11\">Mosiah 3:11<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"33.\" id=\"note33\" data-full-marker=\"33.\">\n<p data-aid=\"165190759\" id=\"p_tmr8L\"><a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2?lang=eng&amp;id=p25#p25\">2 Nephi 2:25<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"34.\" id=\"note34\" data-full-marker=\"34.\">\n<p data-aid=\"165190763\" id=\"p_a1uoa\"><a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/14?lang=eng&amp;id=p5#p5\">Mosiah 14:5<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"35.\" id=\"note35\" data-full-marker=\"35.\">\n<p data-aid=\"165190767\" id=\"p_rjAIn\"><a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/10?lang=eng&amp;id=p4#p4\">Moroni 10:4<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"36.\" id=\"note36\" data-full-marker=\"36.\">\n<p data-aid=\"165190770\" id=\"p_zEWxy\"><a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/10?lang=eng&amp;id=p3#p3\">Moroni 10:3<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"37.\" id=\"note37\" data-full-marker=\"37.\">\n<p data-aid=\"165190774\" id=\"p_mmQKC\">President M. Russell Ballard encouraged us \u201cto bear testimony of what you <em>know<\/em> and <em>believe<\/em> and what you <em>feel<\/em>\u201d (\u201c<a class=\"cross-ref\" href=\"/study/general-conference/2023/04/52ballard?lang=eng&amp;id=p30#p30\">Remember What Matters Most<\/a>,\u201d <cite>Liahona<\/cite>, May 2023, 107).<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"38.\" id=\"note38\" data-full-marker=\"38.\">\n<p data-aid=\"165190778\" id=\"p_iOcsF\">In offering this suggestion, I do not intend to offer a substitute \u201cformula\u201d for a testimony of the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon or the gospel.

As we consider how merciful the Lord has been, we may be tempted to disconnect mercy from justice\u2014to think that our Heavenly Father\u2019s loving mercy alone can overcome justice. But as Alma taught, \u201cThe plan of mercy <em>could not be brought about<\/em> except an atonement should be made; therefore God himself atoneth for the sins of the world, to bring about the plan of mercy, to appease the demands of justice, that God might be a perfect, just God, and a merciful God also\u201d (<a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/42?lang=eng&amp;id=p15#p15\">Alma 42:15<\/a>; emphasis added).<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165190743\" id=\"p_gB29M\">All the Savior\u2019s merciful love for us could not save us. Rather, it was His suffering the very real and painful demands of justice that saves us. This does not, of course, diminish the importance of His love. Surely it was His love for us\u2014and His desire to do the will of the Father, who also loves us\u2014that caused Him to be willing to suffer (see <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/nt/john/3?lang=eng&amp;id=p16#p16\">John 3:16<\/a>; <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/34?lang=eng&amp;id=p3#p3\">Doctrine and Covenants 34:3<\/a>). But love alone could not work.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165190747\" id=\"p_nFMVN\">Sometimes we may focus so much on His love for us just the way we are that we lose sight of the fact that the way we are\u2014as natural men and women whose behavior inevitably falls short of living the commandments\u2014demands that justice be satisfied. If we misunderstand and view His love as doing away with the demands of justice, we diminish the gift of His atoning sacrifice and the suffering He did to pay the terrible price of justice. It would be discouragingly ironic if His love for us were understood to make unnecessary His atoning sacrifice. How much better it is to look squarely at the full demands of justice and to then be grateful that He loved us enough to bear those very real demands on our behalf.<\/p>",

Nephi concludes the very first chapter of the Book of Mormon by saying, \u201cBehold, I, Nephi, will show unto you that the tender mercies of the Lord are over all those whom he hath chosen, because of their faith, to make them mighty even unto the power of deliverance\u201d (<a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/1?lang=eng&amp;id=p20#p20\">1 Nephi 1:20<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165190669\" id=\"p_lwBIR\">In <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/ot/ex/34?lang=eng&amp;id=p6#p6\">Exodus 34:6<\/a>, the Lord proclaims His name to Moses as \u201cThe Lord God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abundant in goodness and truth.\u201d Some have suggested that this verse may be referenced by Old Testament prophets more than any other verse in the Old Testament (see, for example, Bible Project, \u201cThe Most Quoted Verse in the Bible,\u201d bibleproject.com/podcast/most-quoted-verse-bible/).<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165190676\" id=\"p_ncCl5\">In the New Testament, in the book of Luke, recall that Zacharias was struck \u201cdumb, and not able to speak\u201d when he doubted the angel\u2019s promise that Elisabeth in her old age would bear a son, who would be John the Baptist (<a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/nt/luke/1?lang=eng&amp;id=p20#p20\">Luke 1:20<\/a>). When Zacharias\u2019s voice was finally loosed, he was \u201cfilled with the Holy Ghost,\u201d and in the first public declaration that the time for the Messiah had finally arrived, he prophesied that the Lord would come \u201cto perform <em>the mercy<\/em> promised to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant; the oath which he sware to our father Abraham\u201d (<a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/nt/luke/1?lang=eng&amp;id=p67%2Cp72-p73#p67\">Luke 1:67, 72\u201373<\/a>; emphasis added).<\/p>",
