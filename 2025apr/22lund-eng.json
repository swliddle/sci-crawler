Lund<\/p>\n<p class=\"author-role\" data-aid=\"165187999\" id=\"p_ey9Is\">Young Men General President<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"kicker\" data-aid=\"165188005\" id=\"p_w50cf\">I am forever grateful that holders of the Aaronic Priesthood, with its powers, ordinances, and duties, do bless all of us.<\/p>\n<\/header>\n<div class=\"body-block\">\n<p data-aid=\"165188011\" id=\"p_yq13J\">Thank you, Elder Andersen, for that remarkable expression of priesthood power and of the power of the Savior\u2019s Atonement.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188017\" id=\"p_mT2g2\">One Sunday morning this January, as I sat in sacrament meeting, over a dozen young men were sustained to be advanced in the Aaronic Priesthood. I felt the world changing beneath our feet.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188023\" id=\"p_dM3Qq\">It struck me that all around the world, time zone by time zone, in sacrament meetings just like that one, tens of thousands of deacons, teachers, and priests\u2014like President Holland\u2019s friend this morning, Easton\u2014were being sustained to be ordained into lifelong priesthood ministries that would span the length and breadth of the gathering of Israel.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188030\" id=\"p_s0Q8D\">Each January, hands are laid on the heads of about 100,000 young men, connecting them through ordinance to a bright line of authority stretching back through the Restoration epoch to Joseph and Oliver, to John the Baptist, and to Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188037\" id=\"p_nqrFD\">Now, ours is not always a very demonstrative church. Here, we do understatement.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188044\" id=\"p_hiqsD\">But still, seeing this rolling thunder of newly ordained priesthood holders spreading across the earth, I wondered\u2014in a \u201cchurch of joy\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"1\"><\/sup><\/a> kind of way\u2014if it shouldn\u2019t be shouted from the rooftops. \u201cToday,\u201d I thought, \u201cthere should be trumpets and crashing cymbals and blazing Roman candles. There should be parades!\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188050\" id=\"p_r97T3\">Knowing God\u2019s power for what it truly is, we were witness to the disruption of the very patterns of this world by godly authority spreading across the earth.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188056\" id=\"p_wKfw7\">These ordinations launch these young men into lifetimes of service as they will find themselves in consequential times and places where their presence and prayers and the powers of the priesthood of God they hold will profoundly matter.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188062\" id=\"p_wflez\">This controlled chain reaction began with a ministering angel sent of God. The resurrected John the Baptist of ancient times appeared to Joseph and Oliver, placed his hands on their heads, and said, \u201cUpon you my fellow servants, in the name of Messiah I confer the Priesthood of Aaron, which holds the keys of the ministering of angels, and of the gospel of repentance, and of baptism by immersion for the remission of sins\u201d (<a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/13?lang=eng&amp;id=p1#p1\">Doctrine and Covenants 13:1<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188069\" id=\"p_fqHGJ\">John called this authority the \u201cPriesthood of Aaron,\u201d after Moses\u2019s brother and priesthood companion. Anciently, the holders of this priesthood of Aaron were to teach and assist with ordinances\u2014ordinances that focused discipleship on the future Messiah, the Lord Jesus Christ (see <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/ot/deut/33?lang=eng&amp;id=p10#p10\">Deuteronomy 33:10<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188076\" id=\"p_cjZJI\">The book of Numbers explicitly assigns to holders of the priesthood of Aaron the tasks of handling the vessels of the ordinances. \u201cAnd thou shalt appoint Aaron and his sons \u2026 and their charge shall be \u2026 the table \u2026 and the vessels of the sanctuary wherewith they minister\u201d (<a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/ot/num/3?lang=eng&amp;id=p10%2Cp31#p10\">Numbers 3:10, 31<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188082\" id=\"p_aYhfg\">The Old Testament ordinance of animal sacrifice was fulfilled and replaced through the Savior\u2019s life and Atonement. That ancient ordinance was replaced with the ordinance we now call the sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188087\" id=\"p_aJfLL\">The Lord entrusts today\u2019s bearers of the priesthood of Aaron to do very much the same things they did anciently: to teach and to administer ordinances\u2014all to remind us of His Atonement.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188093\" id=\"p_e6m1p\">When deacons, teachers, and priests help with the sacrament, they receive its blessings just like everyone else: by keeping the covenant they make as they individually partake of the bread and the water. But in the performance of these sacred duties, they also learn more about their priesthood roles and responsibilities.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188099\" id=\"p_qoqcm\">The Aaronic Priesthood is called the preparatory priesthood partly because its ordinances allow them to experience the weight and the joy of being on the Lord\u2019s errand, preparing them for future priesthood service, when they may be called upon to minister in unforeseeable ways\u2014including pronouncing inspired blessings in times when hopes and dreams, and even life and death, hang in precarious balance.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188106\" id=\"p_vheya\">Such serious expectations require serious preparation.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188113\" id=\"p_cdSJI\">The Doctrine and Covenants explains that deacons and teachers are \u201cto warn, expound, exhort, and teach, and invite all to come unto Christ\u201d (<a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20?lang=eng&amp;id=p59#p59\">Doctrine and Covenants 20:59<\/a>). In addition to these opportunities, priests are to \u201cpreach \u2026 and baptize\u201d (<a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20?lang=eng&amp;id=p50#p50\">Doctrine and Covenants 20:50<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188120\" id=\"p_soeTj\">Well, all that sounds like a lot, but in the real world, these things happen naturally and all over the world.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188127\" id=\"p_l2Qho\">One bishop taught his new deacons quorum presidency these duties. So the young presidency began to talk about what that might look like in their quorum and in their ward. They decided they should start visiting elderly ward members to see what they needed and then do that.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188133\" id=\"p_fA6IT\">Among those they served was Alan, a rough, often profane, and sometimes hostile neighbor. Alan\u2019s wife, Wanda, became a member of the Church, but Alan was, as we say, something of a piece of work.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188138\" id=\"p_b42L4\">Still, the deacons went to work, comically ignoring his insults, while they shoveled snow and took out trash. Deacons can be hard to hate, and Alan eventually began to love them. At some point they invited him to church.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188147\" id=\"p_m1IGt\">\u201cI don\u2019t like church,\u201d he responded.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188157\" id=\"p_kIEll\">\u201cWell, you like us,\u201d they said. \u201cSo come with us. You can just come to our quorum meeting if you want.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188167\" id=\"p_n471Y\">And with the bishop\u2019s approval, he came\u2014and he kept coming.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188178\" id=\"p_iRVKM\">The deacons became teachers, and as they continued to serve him, he taught them to work on cars and to build things. By the time these deacons-turned-teachers became priests, Alan was calling them \u201cmy boys.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188189\" id=\"p_qKaYQ\">They were earnestly preparing for missions and asked him if they could practice missionary lessons with him. He swore that he would never listen and never believe, but, yeah, they could practice at his house.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188201\" id=\"p_fwjUu\">And then Alan got sick. And he softened.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188210\" id=\"p_oEuB8\">And one day in quorum meeting, he tenderly asked them to pray for him to quit smoking, and so they did. But then they followed him home and confiscated all of his tobacco stash.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188222\" id=\"p_oP6w1\">As his failing health put Alan into hospitals and rehab centers, \u201chis boys\u201d served him, quietly exuding powers of priesthood and of love unfeigned (see <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121?lang=eng&amp;id=p41#p41\">Doctrine and Covenants 121:41<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165188235\" id=\"p_hkwB1\">The miracle continued when Alan asked to be baptized\u2014but then he passed away before it could happen. At his request, his deacons-turned-priests were the pallbearers and the speakers at his funeral, where they\u2014fittingly\u2014warned, expounded, exhorted, taught, and invited all to Christ.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165190248\" id=\"p_dy11u\">And later, in the temple, it was one of \u201cAlan\u2019s boys\u201d who baptized that erstwhile deacons quorum president in proxy for Alan.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165190261\" id=\"p_h5bIG\">Everything John the Baptist said to do, they did. They did what deacons, teachers, and priests do all over this Church and all over this world.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165190274\" id=\"p_bKPa4\">One of the things holders of the priesthood of Aaron are charged to do involves the ordinance of the sacrament.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165190287\" id=\"p_dtHRS\">Last year I met an inspired bishop and his wonderful wife. On a recent Saturday morning, they were driving to their son\u2019s baptism and suffered the tragic and sudden loss of their darling two-year-old daughter, Tess.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165190299\" id=\"p_vqEMC\">The next morning their ward members gathered for sacrament meeting filled with compassion, also suffering over the loss of this perfect little girl. No one expected the bishop\u2019s family to be at church that morning, but a couple of minutes before the meeting started, they quietly entered and took their place.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165190310\" id=\"p_tmvry\">The bishop went to the stand and walked past his usual seat between his counselors and sat down instead between his priests at the sacrament table.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165190322\" id=\"p_peHtd\">During that anguished and sleepless night before of searching for understanding and peace, he had received a strong impression of what his family most needed\u2014and what his ward most needed. It was to hear the voice of their bishop, their ward Aaronic Priesthood president, their grieving father, pronounce the promises of the sacramental covenant.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165190339\" id=\"p_phTKu\">So, in due course, he knelt with those priests and spoke to His Father. With the pathos of that occasion, he pronounced some of the most powerful words that anyone is ever allowed to say out loud in this lifetime.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\" data-value=\"2\"><\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165190349\" id=\"p_gq8iY\">Words of eternal consequence.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165190360\" id=\"p_x5C7t\">Words of ordinance.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165190371\" id=\"p_lYQ9f\">Words of covenant.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165190382\" id=\"p_kko6Z\">Instruction that connects us to the very purposes of this life\u2014and to the most magnificent outcomes of Heavenly Father\u2019s plan for us.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165190393\" id=\"p_fYiP4\">Can you imagine what the congregation heard in that chapel that day\u2014what they felt in the words that we hear every Sunday in our chapels?<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"165190404\" id=\"p_wsPPX\">\u201cO God, the Eternal Father, we ask thee in the name of thy Son, Jesus Christ, to bless and sanctify this bread to the souls of all those who partake of it, that they may eat in remembrance of the body of thy Son, and witness unto thee, O God, the Eternal Father, that they are willing to take upon them the name of thy Son, and always remember him and keep his commandments which he has given them; that they may always have his Spirit to be with them.
