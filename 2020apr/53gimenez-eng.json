Giménez<\/p>\n<p class=\"author-role\" data-aid=\"143140336\" id=\"author2\">Of the Seventy<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"kicker\" data-aid=\"143140341\" id=\"kicker1\">Jesus Christ and His Atonement are the refuge that we all need, regardless of the storms that are battering our lives.<\/p>\n<\/header>\n<div class=\"body-block\">\n<p data-aid=\"143140345\" id=\"p1\">Back in the mid-\u201990s, during my college years, I was part of the Fourth Company of the Santiago Fire Department in Chile. While serving there, I lived at the fire station as part of the night guard. Toward the end of the year, I was told that I had to be at the fire station on New Year\u2019s Eve because on that day there was almost always some emergency. Surprised, I replied, \u201cReally?\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143140346\" id=\"p2\">Well, I remember waiting with my associates when, at midnight, fireworks began shooting off in downtown Santiago. We started hugging each other with well wishes for the new year. Suddenly the bells at the fire station began ringing, indicating that there was an emergency. We got our equipment and jumped on the fire engine. On our way to the emergency, as we passed crowds of people celebrating the new year, I noticed that they were largely unconcerned and carefree. They were relaxed and enjoying the warm summer night. Yet somewhere nearby, the people we were hurrying to help were in serious trouble.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143140352\" id=\"p3\">This experience helped me realize that although our lives may at times be relatively smooth, the time will come for each of us when we will face unexpected challenges and storms that will push the limits of our ability to endure. Physical, mental, family, and employment challenges; natural disasters; and other matters of life or death are but some of the examples of the storms that we will face in this life.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143140356\" id=\"p4\">When faced with these storms, we often experience feelings of despair or fear. President Russell M. Nelson said, \u201cFaith is the antidote for fear\u201d\u2014<em>faith in our Lord Jesus Christ<\/em> (\u201c<a class=\"cross-ref\" href=\"/study/general-conference/2014/04/let-your-faith-show?lang=eng&amp;para=4#p4\">Let Your Faith Show<\/a>,\u201d <cite>Ensign<\/cite> or <cite>Liahona,<\/cite> May 2014, 29). As I have seen the storms that affect people\u2019s lives, I have concluded that no matter what kind of storm is battering us\u2014regardless of whether there is a solution to it or whether there is an end in sight\u2014there is only one refuge, and it is the same for all types of storms. This single refuge provided by our Heavenly Father is our Lord Jesus Christ and His Atonement.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143140394\" id=\"p5\">None of us are exempt from facing these storms. Helaman, a Book of Mormon prophet, taught us as follows: \u201cRemember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall\u201d (<a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/5.12?lang=eng#p12\">Helaman 5:12<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143140398\" id=\"p6\">Elder Robert D. Hales, who had his own experiences with enduring storms, said: \u201cSuffering is universal; how we react to suffering is individual. Suffering can take us one of two ways. It can be a strengthening and purifying experience combined with faith, or it can be a destructive force in our lives if we do not have the faith in the Lord\u2019s atoning sacrifice\u201d (\u201c<a class=\"cross-ref\" href=\"/study/general-conference/1983/10/your-sorrow-shall-be-turned-to-joy?lang=eng&amp;para=33#p33\">Your Sorrow Shall Be Turned to Joy<\/a>,\u201d <cite>Ensign,<\/cite> Nov. 1983, 66).<\/p>\n<span class=\"page-break\" data-page=\"102\"><\/span>\n<p data-aid=\"143140400\" id=\"p7\">In order to enjoy the refuge that Jesus Christ and His Atonement offer, we must have faith in Him\u2014a faith that will allow us to rise above all the pains of a limited, earthly perspective. He has promised that He will make our burdens light if we come unto Him in all that we do.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143140406\" id=\"p8\">\u201cCome unto me,\u201d He said, \u201call ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143140413\" id=\"p9\">\u201cTake my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143140419\" id=\"p10\">\u201cFor my yoke is easy, and my burden is light\u201d (<a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/nt/matt/11.28-30?lang=eng#p28\">Matthew 11:28\u201330<\/a>; see also <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/24.14-15?lang=eng#p14\">Mosiah 24:14\u201315<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143140424\" id=\"p11\">It is said that \u201cto one who has faith, no explanation is necessary. To one without faith, no explanation is possible.\u201d (This statement has been attributed to Thomas Aquinas but is most likely a loose paraphrase of things he taught.) However, we have limited understanding of the things that happen here on earth, and often we do not have answers to the question of <em>why.<\/em> Why is this happening? Why is this happening to <em>me?<\/em> What am I supposed to learn? When answers evade us, that is when the words expressed by our Savior to the Prophet Joseph Smith in Liberty Jail are completely applicable:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143140426\" id=\"p12\">\u201cMy son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment;<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143140434\" id=\"p13\">\u201cAnd then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high\u201d (<a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/121.7-8?lang=eng#p7\">Doctrine and Covenants 121:7\u20138<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143140439\" id=\"p14\">Although many people indeed believe <em>in<\/em> Jesus Christ, the key question is whether we <em>believe<\/em> Him and whether we <em>believe<\/em> the things that He teaches us and asks us to do. Perhaps someone might think, \u201cWhat does Jesus Christ know about what is happening to me? How does He know what I need to be happy?\u201d Truly, it was our Redeemer and Intercessor to whom the prophet Isaiah was referring when he said:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143140441\" id=\"p15\">\u201cHe is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief. \u2026<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143140447\" id=\"p16\">\u201cSurely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows. \u2026<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143140451\" id=\"p17\">\u201cBut he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed\u201d (<a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/ot/isa/53.3-5?lang=eng#p3\">Isaiah 53:3\u20135<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143140455\" id=\"p18\">The Apostle Peter also taught us about the Savior, saying, \u201cWho his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness: by whose stripes ye were healed\u201d (<a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/nt/1-pet/2.24?lang=eng#p24\">1 Peter 2:24<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143140458\" id=\"p19\">Although the time of Peter\u2019s own martyrdom was approaching, his words are not filled with fear or pessimism; rather, he taught the Saints to \u201crejoice,\u201d even though they were \u201cin heaviness through manifold temptations.\u201d Peter counseled us to remember that \u201cthe trial of [our] faith, \u2026 though it be tried with fire,\u201d would lead to \u201cpraise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ\u201d and to \u201cthe salvation of [our] souls\u201d (<a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/nt/1-pet/1.6-7,9?lang=eng#p6\">1 Peter 1:6\u20137, 9<\/a>).<\/p>\n<span class=\"page-break\" data-page=\"103\"><\/span>\n<p data-aid=\"143140463\" id=\"p20\">Peter continued:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143140465\" id=\"p21\">\u201cBeloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143140467\" id=\"p22\">\u201cBut rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ\u2019s sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be glad also with exceeding joy\u201d (<a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/nt/1-pet/4.12-13?lang=eng#p12\">1 Peter 4:12\u201313<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143140469\" id=\"p23\">President Russell M. Nelson taught that \u201cSaints can be happy under every circumstance. \u2026 When the focus of our lives is on God\u2019s plan of salvation \u2026 and Jesus Christ and His gospel, we can feel joy regardless of what is happening\u2014or not happening\u2014in our lives. Joy comes from and because of Him. He is the source of all joy\u201d (\u201c<a class=\"cross-ref\" href=\"/study/general-conference/2016/10/joy-and-spiritual-survival?lang=eng&amp;para=13#p13\">Joy and Spiritual Survival<\/a>,\u201d <cite>Ensign<\/cite> or <cite>Liahona,<\/cite> Nov. 2016, 82).<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143140473\" id=\"p24\">Of course, it is easier to say these things when we are not in the midst of a storm than to live and apply them during the storm. But as your brother, I hope you can feel that I sincerely want to share with you how valuable it is to know that Jesus Christ and His Atonement are the refuge that we all need, regardless of the storms that are battering our lives.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143140478\" id=\"p37\">I know that we are all children of God, that He loves us, and that we are not alone. I invite you to come and see that He can lighten your burdens and be the refuge you are seeking. Come and help others find the refuge that they so yearn for. Come and stay with us in this refuge, which will help you resist the storms of life. There is no doubt in my heart that if you come, you will see, you will help, and you will stay.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143140483\" id=\"p25\">The prophet Alma testified the following to his son Helaman: \u201cI do know that whosoever shall put their trust in God shall be supported in their trials, and their troubles, and their afflictions, and shall be lifted up at the last day\u201d (<a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/36.3?lang=eng#p3\">Alma 36:3<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143140488\" id=\"p26\">The Savior Himself said:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143140494\" id=\"p36\">\u201cLet your hearts be comforted \u2026 ; for all flesh is in mine hands; be still and know that I am God. \u2026<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143140498\" id=\"p27\">\u201cWherefore, fear not even unto death; for in this world your joy is not full, but in me your joy is full\u201d (<a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/101.16,36?lang=eng#p16\">Doctrine and Covenants 101:16, 36<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143140505\" id=\"p28\">The hymn \u201cBe Still, My Soul,\u201d which has touched my heart on many occasions, has a message of comfort for our souls. The lyrics read as follows:<\/p>\n<div class=\"poetry\">\n<div class=\"stanza\">\n<p class=\"line\" data-aid=\"143140511\" id=\"p29\">Be still, my soul: The hour is hast\u2019ning on<\/p>\n<p class=\"line\" data-aid=\"143140513\" id=\"p30\">When we shall be forever with the Lord,<\/p>\n<p class=\"line\" data-aid=\"143140519\" id=\"p31\">When disappointment, grief, and fear are gone,<\/p>\n<p class=\"line\" data-aid=\"143140522\" id=\"p32\">Sorrow forgot, love\u2019s purest joys restored.<\/p>\n<p class=\"line\" data-aid=\"143140527\" id=\"p33\">Be still, my soul: When change and tears are past,<\/p>\n<p class=\"line\" data-aid=\"143140534\" id=\"p34\">All safe and blessed we shall meet at last.
