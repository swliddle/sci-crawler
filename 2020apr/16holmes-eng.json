Holmes<\/p>\n<p class=\"author-role\" data-aid=\"143138504\" id=\"author2\">Recently Released First Counselor in the Young Men General Presidency<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"kicker\" data-aid=\"143138511\" id=\"kicker1\">The Lord is trying to help us\u2014all of us\u2014get His gospel deeper in our hearts.<\/p>\n<\/header>\n<div class=\"body-block\">\n<p data-aid=\"143138516\" id=\"p1\">Sisters and brothers, what a wonderful time we live in. As we celebrate the beginning of the Restoration, it is also appropriate to celebrate the ongoing Restoration that we are witnessing. I rejoice with you to live in this day.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\">1<\/sup><\/a> The Lord continues to put in place, through His prophets, all that is needed to help us prepare to receive Him.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\">2<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143138519\" id=\"p2\">One of those needed things is the new Children and Youth initiative. Many of you are familiar with this program\u2019s emphasis on setting goals, new emblems of belonging, and For the Strength of Youth conferences. But we must not let those cloud our view of the principles the program is built on and their purpose: to help get the gospel of Jesus Christ deep in the hearts of our children and youth.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\">3<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143138524\" id=\"p3\">I believe as we come to see these principles more clearly, we will recognize this as more than a program for members ages 8 to 18. We will see how the Lord is trying to help us\u2014all of us\u2014get His gospel deeper in our hearts. I pray the Holy Ghost will help us learn together.<\/p>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"143138529\" id=\"title2\">Relationships\u2014\u201cBe with Them\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\">4<\/sup><\/a><\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"143138534\" id=\"p4\">The first principle is relationships. Because they are such a natural part of the Church of Jesus Christ, we sometimes forget the importance of relationships in our ongoing journey to Christ. We are not expected to find or walk the covenant path alone. We need love and support from parents, other family members, friends, and leaders who are also walking the path.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143138538\" id=\"p5\">These kinds of relationships take time. Time to be together. Time to laugh, play, learn, and serve together. Time to appreciate each other\u2019s interests and challenges. Time to be open and honest with each other as we strive to be better together. These relationships are one of the primary purposes of gathering as families, quorums, classes, and congregations. They are the foundation for effective ministering.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\">5<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143138544\" id=\"p6\">Elder Dale G. Renlund gave us a key to developing these relationships when he said: \u201cTo effectively serve others we must see them \u2026 through Heavenly Father\u2019s eyes. Only then can we begin to comprehend the true worth of a soul. Only then can we sense the love that Heavenly Father has for all His children.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\">6<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143138550\" id=\"p7\">Seeing others as God does is a gift. I invite all of us to seek for this gift. As our eyes are opened to see,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\">7<\/sup><\/a> we will also be able to help others see themselves as God does.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\">8<\/sup><\/a> President Henry B. Eyring emphasized the power of this when he said: \u201cWhat will matter most is what [others] learn from [you] about who they really are and what they can really become. My guess is that they won\u2019t learn it so much from lectures. They will get it from <em>feelings<\/em> of who you are, who you think they are, and what you think they might become.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\">9<\/sup><\/a> Helping others understand their true identity <span class=\"page-break\" data-page=\"24\"><\/span>and purpose is one of the greatest gifts we can give.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\">10<\/sup><\/a> Seeing others and ourselves as God does knits our hearts \u201ctogether in unity and in love.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\">11<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143138560\" id=\"p8\">With ever-increasing secular forces pulling at us, we need the strength that comes from loving relationships. So as we plan activities, meetings, and other gatherings, let us remember an overarching purpose of these gatherings is to build loving relationships that unite us and help get the gospel of Jesus Christ deeper in our hearts.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\">12<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"143138565\" id=\"title3\">Revelation, Agency, and Repentance\u2014\u201cConnect Them with Heaven\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\">13<\/sup><\/a><\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"143138571\" id=\"p9\">Of course, it\u2019s not enough just to be bound together. There are many groups and organizations that achieve unity around a variety of causes. But the unity we seek is to be one in Christ, to connect ourselves with Him.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note14\"><sup class=\"marker\">14<\/sup><\/a> To connect our hearts with heaven, we need individual spiritual experiences, as Elder Andersen just eloquently spoke to us about.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note15\"><sup class=\"marker\">15<\/sup><\/a> Those experiences come as the Holy Ghost carries the word and love of God to our mind and heart.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note16\"><sup class=\"marker\">16<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143138576\" id=\"p10\">This revelation comes through the scriptures, especially the Book of Mormon; through inspired words of living prophets and other faithful disciples; and through the still, small voice.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note17\"><sup class=\"marker\">17<\/sup><\/a> These words are more than ink on a page, sound waves in our ears, thoughts in our minds, or feelings in our hearts. The word of God is spiritual power.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note18\"><sup class=\"marker\">18<\/sup><\/a> It is truth and light.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note19\"><sup class=\"marker\">19<\/sup><\/a> It is how we hear Him! The word initiates and increases our faith in Christ and fuels within us a desire to become more like the Savior\u2014that is, to repent and walk the covenant path.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note20\"><sup class=\"marker\">20<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143138582\" id=\"p11\">Last April, President Russell M. Nelson helped us understand the central role of repentance in this revelatory journey.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note21\"><sup class=\"marker\">21<\/sup><\/a> He said: \u201cWhen we choose to repent, we choose to change! We allow the Savior to transform us into the best version of ourselves. \u2026 We choose to become more like Jesus Christ!\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note22\"><sup class=\"marker\">22<\/sup><\/a> This process of change, fueled by the word of God, is how we connect with heaven.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143138590\" id=\"p12\">Underlying President Nelson\u2019s invitation to repent is the principle of agency. We must <em>choose<\/em> repentance for ourselves. The gospel can\u2019t be forced into our hearts.
