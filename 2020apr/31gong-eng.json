In the book of Revelation, those who praise God and the Lamb do so \u201cclothed with white robes, and palms in their hands.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\">6<\/sup><\/a> Along with \u201crobes of righteousness\u201d and \u201ccrowns of glory,\u201d palms are included in the Kirtland Temple dedicatory prayer.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\">7<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143139855\" id=\"p6\">Of course, the significance of Palm Sunday goes beyond crowds greeting Jesus with palms. On Palm Sunday, Jesus entered Jerusalem in ways the faithful recognized as fulfillment of prophecy. As Zechariah<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\">8<\/sup><\/a> and the Psalmist prophetically foretold, our Lord entered Jerusalem riding a colt as multitudes knowingly cried, \u201cHosanna in the highest.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\">9<\/sup><\/a> Hosanna means \u201csave now.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\">10<\/sup><\/a> Then, as now, we rejoice, \u201cBlessed be he that cometh in the name of the Lord.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\">11<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143139862\" id=\"p7\">A week following Palm Sunday is Easter Sunday. President Russell M. Nelson teaches that Jesus Christ \u201ccame to pay a debt He didn\u2019t owe because we owed a debt we couldn\u2019t pay.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\">12<\/sup><\/a> Indeed, through the Atonement of Christ, all God\u2019s children \u201cmay be saved, by obedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\">13<\/sup><\/a> At Easter, we sing hallelujah. Hallelujah means \u201cpraise ye the Lord Jehovah.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note14\"><sup class=\"marker\">14<\/sup><\/a> The \u201cHallelujah Chorus\u201d in Handel\u2019s <em>Messiah<\/em> is a beloved Easter declaration that He is \u201cKing of Kings, and Lord of Lords.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note15\"><sup class=\"marker\">15<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143139869\" id=\"p8\">The sacred events between Palm Sunday and Easter Sunday are the story of hosanna and hallelujah. Hosanna is our plea for God to save. Hallelujah expresses our praise to the Lord for the hope of salvation and exaltation. In hosanna and hallelujah we recognize the living Jesus Christ as the heart of Easter and latter-day restoration.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143139876\" id=\"p9\">Latter-day restoration begins with theophany\u2014the literal appearance of God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, to the young prophet Joseph Smith. Said the Prophet Joseph, \u201cCould you gaze into heaven five minutes, you would know more than you would by reading all that ever was written on the subject.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note16\"><sup class=\"marker\">16<\/sup><\/a> Because the heavens are again open, we know and \u201cbelieve in God, the Eternal Father, and in His Son, Jesus Christ, and in the Holy Ghost\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note17\"><sup class=\"marker\">17<\/sup><\/a>\u2014the divine Godhead.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143139882\" id=\"p10\">On Easter Sunday, April 3, 1836, in the early days of the Restoration, the living Jesus Christ appeared after the Kirtland Temple was dedicated. Those who saw Him there testified of Him in complementary contrasts of fire and water: \u201cHis eyes were as a flame of <em>fire;<\/em> the hair of his head was white like the <em>pure snow;<\/em> his countenance shone above the <em>brightness of the sun;<\/em> and his voice was as the sound of the <em>rushing of great waters,<\/em> even the voice of Jehovah.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note18\"><sup class=\"marker\">18<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143139888\" id=\"p11\">On that occasion, our Savior declared, \u201cI am the first and the last; I am he who liveth, I am he who was slain; I am your advocate with the Father.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note19\"><sup class=\"marker\">19<\/sup><\/a> Again, complementary contrasts\u2014first and last, living and <span class=\"page-break\" data-page=\"54\"><\/span>slain. He is Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note20\"><sup class=\"marker\">20<\/sup><\/a> the author and finisher of our faith.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note21\"><sup class=\"marker\">21<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143139892\" id=\"p12\">Following the appearance of Jesus Christ, Moses, Elias, and Elijah also came. By divine direction, these great prophets of old restored priesthood keys and authority. Thus, \u201cthe keys of this dispensation are committed\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note22\"><sup class=\"marker\">22<\/sup><\/a> within His restored Church to bless all God\u2019s children.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143139900\" id=\"p13\">The coming of Elijah in the Kirtland Temple also fulfilled Malachi\u2019s Old Testament prophecy that Elijah would return \u201cbefore the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note23\"><sup class=\"marker\">23<\/sup><\/a> In doing so, Elijah\u2019s appearance coincided, though not by coincidence, with the Jewish Passover season, which tradition reverently anticipates Elijah\u2019s return.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143139907\" id=\"p14\">Many devout Jewish families set a place for Elijah at their Passover table. Many fill a cup to the brim to invite and welcome him. And some, during the traditional Passover Seder, send a child to the door, sometimes left partly open, to see if Elijah is outside waiting to be invited in.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note24\"><sup class=\"marker\">24<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143139913\" id=\"p15\">In fulfillment of prophecy and as part of the promised restoration of all things,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note25\"><sup class=\"marker\">25<\/sup><\/a> Elijah did come as promised, at Easter and the onset of Passover. He brought the sealing authority to bind families on earth and in heaven. As Moroni taught the Prophet Joseph, Elijah \u201cshall plant in the hearts of the children the promises made to the fathers, and the hearts of the children shall turn to their fathers. If it were not so,\u201d Moroni continued, \u201cthe whole earth would be utterly wasted at [the Lord\u2019s] coming.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note26\"><sup class=\"marker\">26<\/sup><\/a> The spirit of Elijah, a manifestation of the Holy Ghost, draws us to our generations\u2014past, present, and future\u2014in our genealogies, histories, and temple service.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143139921\" id=\"p16\">Let us also briefly recall what Passover signifies. Passover remembers the deliverance of the children of Israel from 400 years of bondage. The book of Exodus relates how this deliverance came after plagues of frogs, lice, flies, the death of cattle, boils, blains, hail and fire, locusts, and thick darkness. The final plague threatened the death of the firstborn in the land but not in the house of Israel if\u2014if those households put the blood of an unblemished firstling lamb on the lintels of their doors.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note27\"><sup class=\"marker\">27<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143139928\" id=\"p17\">The angel of death passed by the houses marked with the symbolic blood of the lamb.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note28\"><sup class=\"marker\">28<\/sup><\/a> That passing by, or pass over, represents Jesus Christ ultimately overcoming death. Indeed, the atoning blood of the Lamb of God gives our Good Shepherd power to gather His people in all places and circumstances into the safety of His fold on both sides of the veil.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143139937\" id=\"p18\">Significantly, the Book of Mormon describes the \u201cpower and resurrection of Christ\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note29\"><sup class=\"marker\">29<\/sup><\/a>\u2014the essence of Easter\u2014in terms of two restorations.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143139944\" id=\"p19\">First, resurrection includes physical restoration of our \u201cproper and perfect frame\u201d; \u201cevery limb and joint,\u201d \u201ceven a hair of the head shall not be lost.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note30\"><sup class=\"marker\">30<\/sup><\/a> This promise gives hope to those who have lost limbs; those who have lost ability to see, hear, or walk; or those thought lost to relentless disease, mental illness, or other diminished capacity. He finds us. He makes us whole.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143139953\" id=\"p20\">A second promise of Easter and our Lord\u2019s Atonement is that, spiritually, \u201call things shall be restored to their proper order.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note31\"><sup class=\"marker\">31<\/sup><\/a> This spiritual restoration reflects our works and desires. Like bread upon the water,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note32\"><sup class=\"marker\">32<\/sup><\/a> it restores \u201cthat which is good,\u201d \u201crighteous,\u201d \u201cjust,\u201d and \u201cmerciful.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note33\"><sup class=\"marker\">33<\/sup><\/a> No wonder the prophet Alma uses the word <em>restore<\/em> 22 times<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note34\"><sup class=\"marker\">34<\/sup><\/a> as he urges us to \u201cdeal justly, judge righteously, and do good continually.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note35\"><sup class=\"marker\">35<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143139959\" id=\"p21\">Because \u201cGod himself atoneth for the sins of the world,\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note36\"><sup class=\"marker\">36<\/sup><\/a> the Lord\u2019s Atonement can make whole not only what was but also what can be. Because He knows our pains, afflictions, sicknesses, our \u201ctemptations of every kind,\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note37\"><sup class=\"marker\">37<\/sup><\/a> He can, with mercy, succor us according to our infirmities.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note38\"><sup class=\"marker\">38<\/sup><\/a> Because God is \u201ca perfect, just God, and a merciful God also,\u201d the plan of mercy can \u201cappease the demands of justice.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note39\"><sup class=\"marker\">39<\/sup><\/a> We repent and do all we can. He encircles us eternally \u201cin the arms of his love.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note40\"><sup class=\"marker\">40<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143139965\" id=\"p22\">Today we celebrate restoration and resurrection. With you, I rejoice in the ongoing Restoration of the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ.

Mortal men were cruelly crucified and later resurrected. But only the living Jesus Christ in His perfect resurrected form still bears the marks of crucifixion in His hands, feet, and side. Only He can say, \u201cI have graven thee upon the palms of my hands.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note41\"><sup class=\"marker\">41<\/sup><\/a> Only He can say: \u201cI am he who was lifted up.

Truly, \u201ceye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note43\"><sup class=\"marker\">43<\/sup><\/a> In these times, we can learn much of God\u2019s goodness and our divine potential for God\u2019s love to grow in us as we seek Him and reach out to each other. In new ways and new places, we can do and become, line upon line, kindness upon kindness, individually and together.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143139982\" id=\"p25\">Dear brothers and sisters everywhere, as we meet and learn together, your faith and goodness fill me with a sense of gospel adventure and gratitude. Your testimony and gospel journey enrich my testimony and gospel journey. Your concerns and joys, your love for the household of God and community of Saints, and your lived understanding of restored truth and light increase my fulness of the restored gospel, with the living Jesus Christ at its heart.
