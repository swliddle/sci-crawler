Andersen<\/p>\n<p class=\"author-role\" data-aid=\"143138479\" id=\"author2\">Of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"kicker\" data-aid=\"143138481\" id=\"kicker1\">When personal difficulties or world conditions beyond our control darken our path, the spiritually defining memories from our book of life are like luminous stones that help brighten the road ahead.<\/p>\n<\/header>\n<div class=\"body-block\">\n<p data-aid=\"143138483\" id=\"p1\">Eighteen years after the First Vision, the Prophet Joseph Smith wrote an extensive account of his experience. He had faced opposition, persecution, harassment, threats, and brutal attacks.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\">1<\/sup><\/a> Yet he continued to boldly testify of his First Vision: \u201cI had actually seen a light, and in the midst of that light I saw two Personages, and they did in reality speak to me; and though I was hated and persecuted for saying that I had seen a vision, yet it was true. \u2026 <span class=\"page-break\" data-page=\"19\"><\/span>I knew it, and I knew that God knew it, and I could not deny it.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\">2<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143138487\" id=\"p2\">In his difficult hours, Joseph\u2019s memory reached back nearly two decades to the certainty of God\u2019s love for him and the events that welcomed in the long-foretold Restoration. Reflecting on his spiritual journey, Joseph said: \u201cI don\u2019t blame any one for not believing my history. If I had not experienced what I have, I would not have believed it myself.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\">3<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143138491\" id=\"p3\">But the experiences were real, and he never forgot or denied them, quietly confirming his testimony as he moved to Carthage. \u201cI am going like a lamb to the slaughter,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I am calm as a summer\u2019s morning; I have a conscience void of offense towards God, and towards all men.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\">4<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"143138495\" id=\"title2\">Your Spiritually Defining Experiences<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"143138499\" id=\"p4\">There is a lesson for us in the Prophet Joseph\u2019s example. Along with the peaceful direction we receive from the Holy Ghost, from time to time, God powerfully and very personally assures each of us that He knows us and loves us and that He is blessing us specifically and openly. Then, in our moments of difficulty, the Savior brings these experiences back into our mind.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143138507\" id=\"p5\">Think of your own life. Over the years, I have listened to thousands of profoundly spiritual experiences from Latter-day Saints all across the world, confirming to me beyond any question that God knows and loves each of us and that He eagerly desires to reveal Himself to us. These experiences may come at pivotal times in our lives or in what may at first seem as uneventful happenings, but they are always accompanied by an exceptionally strong spiritual confirmation of the love of God.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143138512\" id=\"p6\">Remembering these spiritually defining experiences takes us to our knees, declaring as did the Prophet Joseph: \u201cWhat I received was from heaven. I know it, and I know that God knows that I know it.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\">5<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"143138515\" id=\"title3\">Four Examples<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"143138520\" id=\"p7\">Reflect on your own spiritually defining memories as I share a few examples from others.<\/p>\n<img id=\"img1\" src=\"https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/b2/65/b26500151d83ec17c9d61cccc001534e82317471/russell_m_nelson_physician_1982.png\" data-img-id=\"2349936\" srcset=\"https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/36/02/3602fb6220b619c23a19edba1d68bbb64d493e71/russell_m_nelson_physician_1982.png 60w,https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/11/16/1116d491c00b4e49160f88f13015206e1c8ed3af/russell_m_nelson_physician_1982.png 100w,https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/ab/76/ab769dc34efaa22f4be2e5c35d2e91b34d30dbb1/russell_m_nelson_physician_1982.png 200w,https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/86/59/86590dc28a01dd86b0c1825a67c275ce78978637/russell_m_nelson_physician_1982.png 250w,https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/e1/e0/e1e06c2d831fcd8ecd589926b5c400de3fe3b1f7/russell_m_nelson_physician_1982.png 320w,https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/b2/65/b26500151d83ec17c9d61cccc001534e82317471/russell_m_nelson_physician_1982.png 500w,https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/f2/3b/f23b053e207ba28db81f8069bedd7d9cb1fed068/russell_m_nelson_physician_1982.png 640w\" data-assetId=\"96b0d22645377e34d1f61ee369b8da4af4c2af72\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"775\" data-aspect-ratio=\"0.6451612903225806\" alt=\"Russell M Nelson\"/>\n<p data-aid=\"143138525\" id=\"p44\">Years ago, an elderly stake patriarch with two failing heart valves pleaded for then-Dr. Russell M. Nelson to intervene, although at that time there was not a surgical solution for the damaged second valve. Dr. Nelson finally agreed to do the surgery. Here are President Nelson\u2019s words:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143138528\" id=\"p8\">\u201cAfter relieving the obstruction of the first valve, we exposed the second valve. We found it to be intact but so badly dilated that it could no longer function as it should. While examining this valve, a message was distinctly impressed upon my mind: <i>Reduce the circumference of the ring.<\/i> I announced that message to my assistant. \u2018The valve tissue will be sufficient <em>if<\/em> we can effectively reduce the ring toward its normal size.\u2019<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143138533\" id=\"p9\">\u201cBut how? \u2026 A picture came vividly to my mind, showing how stitches could be placed\u2014to make a pleat here and a tuck there. \u2026 I still remember that mental image\u2014complete with dotted lines where sutures should be placed. The repair was completed as diagrammed in my mind. We tested the valve and found the leak to be reduced remarkably. My assistant said, \u2018It\u2019s a miracle.\u2019\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\">6<\/sup><\/a> The patriarch lived for many years.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143138539\" id=\"p10\">Dr. Nelson had been directed.

Beatrice recently told me of an experience that impacted her spiritual life shortly after her baptism as a teenager. Here are her words:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143138549\" id=\"p12\">\u201cThe youth of our branch had traveled with their leaders to Lacanau Beach, an hour and a half from Bordeaux.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143138559\" id=\"p13\">\u201cBefore returning home, one of the leaders decided to take a last swim and dove into the waves with his glasses.

As I was sweeping the ocean\u2019s surface, his pair of glasses rested in my hand. A powerful feeling pierced my soul that God does actually hear and answer our prayers.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\">7<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143138587\" id=\"p45\">Forty-five years later, she recalled it as if it had happened yesterday.

Speaking of her conversion, Sister Damasio told me that missionaries in her village had given a priesthood blessing to a critically ill baby who miraculously recovered. She wanted to know more. As she prayed about their message, an undeniable witness of the Spirit confirmed to her that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God. At 103, she was baptized, and at 104, she was endowed. Every year after, she made the 14-hour bus ride to spend a week in the temple. Sister Damasio had received a heavenly confirmation, and she knew that God knew that she knew that the witness was true.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143138609\" id=\"p22\">Here is a spiritual memory from my first mission to France 48 years ago.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143138614\" id=\"p23\">While tracting, my companion and I left a Book of Mormon with an elderly woman. When we returned to the woman\u2019s apartment about a week later, she opened the door. Before any words were spoken, I felt a tangible spiritual power. The intense feelings continued as Madame Alice Audubert invited us in and told us she had read the Book of Mormon and knew that it was true. As we left her apartment that day, I prayed, \u201cHeavenly Father, please help me to never forget what I have just felt.\u201d I never have.<\/p>\n<img id=\"img4\" src=\"https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/21/2a/212a6e27f4fde534d123ea50127fc8d9c725b5d4/neil_l_andersen_missionary_baptism.png\" data-img-id=\"2349939\" srcset=\"https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/f0/7a/f07a6da552bf9011c44dde8640bf1a6784c141ff/neil_l_andersen_missionary_baptism.png 60w,https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/c3/2d/c32d9b76ad746ada45b299ee42d691e818b5660a/neil_l_andersen_missionary_baptism.png 100w,https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/48/9a/489ade6e4e0b454b42654b3d2a36100aa63208fc/neil_l_andersen_missionary_baptism.png 200w,https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/eb/75/eb7561d841db2a6d46f4fc16f3afa121050d7950/neil_l_andersen_missionary_baptism.png 250w,https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/01/9f/019f3e7ba700157990b1c76af820ef491f523b37/neil_l_andersen_missionary_baptism.png 320w,https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/21/2a/212a6e27f4fde534d123ea50127fc8d9c725b5d4/neil_l_andersen_missionary_baptism.png 500w,https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/d8/e5/d8e5e946242be3ee7913a73305241b5787d7e314/neil_l_andersen_missionary_baptism.png 640w\" data-assetId=\"13c218f16e8a744651c5e56a2ab5020eb7330a34\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"323\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.5479876160990713\" alt=\"Neil L.

spiritual memories this way. With constant prayer, a determination to keep our covenants, and the gift of the Holy Ghost, we navigate our way through life. When personal difficulty, doubt, or discouragement darken our path, or when world conditions beyond our control lead us to wonder about the future, the spiritually defining memories from our book of life are like luminous stones that help brighten the road ahead, assuring us that God knows us, loves us, and has sent His Son, Jesus Christ, to help us return home. And when someone sets their defining memories aside and is lost or confused, we turn them toward the Savior as we share our faith and memories with them, helping them rediscover those precious spiritual moments they once treasured.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143139717\" id=\"p37\">Some experiences are so sacred that we guard them in our spiritual memory and do not share them.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note20\"><sup class=\"marker\">20<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143139730\" id=\"p38\">\u201cAngels speak by the power of the Holy Ghost; wherefore, they speak the words of Christ.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note21\"><sup class=\"marker\">21<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143139739\" id=\"p39\">\u201cAngels [have not] ceased to minister unto the children of men.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143139743\" id=\"p40\">\u201cFor behold, they are subject unto [Christ], to minister according to \u2026 his command, showing themselves unto them of strong faith and a firm mind in every form of godliness.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note22\"><sup class=\"marker\">22<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143139749\" id=\"p41\">And \u201cthe Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, \u2026 shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note23\"><sup class=\"marker\">23<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143139756\" id=\"p42\">Embrace your sacred memories.
