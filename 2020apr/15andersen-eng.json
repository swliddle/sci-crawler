He had faced opposition, persecution, harassment, threats, and brutal attacks.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\">1<\/sup><\/a> Yet he continued to boldly testify of his First Vision: &#x201C;I had actually seen a light, and in the midst of that light I saw two Personages, and they did in reality speak to me; and though I was hated and persecuted for saying that I had seen a vision, yet it was true. &#x2026; I knew it, and I knew that God knew it, and I could not deny it.&#x201D;<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\">2<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143138487\" id=\"p2\">In his difficult hours, Joseph&#x2019;s memory reached back nearly two decades to the certainty of God&#x2019;s love for him and the events that welcomed in the long-foretold Restoration. Reflecting on his spiritual journey, Joseph said: &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t blame any one for not believing my history. If I had not experienced what I have, I would not have believed it myself.&#x201D;<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\">3<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143138491\" id=\"p3\">But the experiences were real, and he never forgot or denied them, quietly confirming his testimony as he moved to Carthage. &#x201C;I am going like a lamb to the slaughter,&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;but I am calm as a summer&#x2019;s morning; I have a conscience void of offense towards God, and towards all men.&#x201D;<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\">4<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"143138495\" id=\"title2\">Your Spiritually Defining Experiences<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"143138499\" id=\"p4\">There is a lesson for us in the Prophet Joseph&#x2019;s example. Along with the peaceful direction we receive from the Holy Ghost, from time to time, God powerfully and very personally assures each of us that He knows us and loves us and that He is blessing us specifically and openly. Then, in our moments of difficulty, the Savior brings these experiences back into our mind.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143138507\" id=\"p5\">Think of your own life. Over the years, I have listened to thousands of profoundly spiritual experiences from Latter-day Saints all across the world, confirming to me beyond any question that God knows and loves each of us and that He eagerly desires to reveal Himself to us. These experiences may come at pivotal times in our lives or in what may at first seem as uneventful happenings, but they are always accompanied by an exceptionally strong spiritual confirmation of the love of God.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143138512\" id=\"p6\">Remembering these spiritually defining experiences takes us to our knees, declaring as did the Prophet Joseph: &#x201C;What I received was from heaven. I know it, and I know that God knows that I know it.&#x201D;<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\">5<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"143138515\" id=\"title3\">Four Examples<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"143138520\" id=\"p7\">Reflect on your own spiritually defining memories as I share a few examples from others. <\/p>\n<img alt=\"Dr. Russell M.

Nelson to intervene, although at that time there was not a surgical solution for the damaged second valve. Dr.&#xA0;Nelson finally agreed to do the surgery. Here are President Nelson&#x2019;s words:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143138528\" id=\"p8\">&#x201C;After relieving the obstruction of the first valve, we exposed the second valve. We found it to be intact but so badly dilated that it could no longer function as it should. While examining this valve, a message was distinctly impressed upon my mind: <i>Reduce the circumference of the ring.<\/i> I announced that message to my assistant. &#x2018;The valve tissue will be sufficient <em>if<\/em> we can effectively reduce the ring toward its normal size.&#x2019;<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143138533\" id=\"p9\">&#x201C;But how? &#x2026; A picture came vividly to my mind, showing how stitches could be placed&#xFEFF;&#x2014;to make a pleat here and a tuck there. &#x2026; I still remember that mental image&#xFEFF;&#x2014;complete with dotted lines where sutures should be placed.

Beatrice recently told me of an experience that impacted her spiritual life shortly after her baptism as a teenager. Here are her words:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143138549\" id=\"p12\">&#x201C;The youth of our branch had traveled with their leaders to Lacanau Beach, an hour and a half from Bordeaux.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143138559\" id=\"p13\">&#x201C;Before returning home, one of the leaders decided to take a last swim and dove into the waves with his glasses. When he resurfaced, his glasses had disappeared. &#x2026; They were lost in the ocean.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143138566\" id=\"p14\">&#x201C;The loss of his glasses would prevent him from driving his car. We would be stranded far from home.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143138572\" id=\"p15\">&#x201C;A sister filled with faith suggested that we pray.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143138579\" id=\"p16\">&#x201C;I murmured that praying would avail us absolutely nothing, and I uneasily joined the group to pray publicly as we stood waist-deep in the murky water.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143138583\" id=\"p17\">&#x201C;Once the prayer was over, I stretched my arms to splash everyone. As I was sweeping the ocean&#x2019;s surface, his pair of glasses rested in my hand. A powerful feeling pierced my soul that God does actually hear and answer our prayers.&#x201D;<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\">7<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143138587\" id=\"p45\">Forty-five years later, she recalled it as if it had happened yesterday.

Floripes Luzia Damasio of the Ipatinga Brazil Stake was 114 years old. Speaking of her conversion, Sister Damasio told me that missionaries in her village had given a priesthood blessing to a critically ill baby who miraculously recovered. She wanted to know more. As she prayed about their message, an undeniable witness of the Spirit confirmed to her that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God. At 103, she was baptized, and at 104, she was endowed. Every year after, she made the 14-hour bus ride to spend a week in the temple. Sister Damasio had received a heavenly confirmation, and she knew that God knew that she knew that the witness was true.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143138609\" id=\"p22\">Here is a spiritual memory from my first mission to France 48 years ago.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143138614\" id=\"p23\">While tracting, my companion and I left a Book of Mormon with an elderly woman. When we returned to the woman&#x2019;s apartment about a week later, she opened the door. Before any words were spoken, I felt a tangible spiritual power. The intense feelings continued as Madame Alice Audubert invited us in and told us she had read the Book of Mormon and knew that it was true. As we left her apartment that day, I prayed, &#x201C;Heavenly Father, please help me to never forget what I have just felt.&#x201D; I never have.<\/p>\n<img alt=\"Elder Andersen as a missionary\" id=\"img4\" src=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/21/2a/212a6e27f4fde534d123ea50127fc8d9c725b5d4/neil_l_andersen_missionary_baptism.png\" data-img-id=\"2349939\" srcset=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/f0/7a/f07a6da552bf9011c44dde8640bf1a6784c141ff/neil_l_andersen_missionary_baptism.png 60w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/c3/2d/c32d9b76ad746ada45b299ee42d691e818b5660a/neil_l_andersen_missionary_baptism.png 100w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/48/9a/489ade6e4e0b454b42654b3d2a36100aa63208fc/neil_l_andersen_missionary_baptism.png 200w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/eb/75/eb7561d841db2a6d46f4fc16f3afa121050d7950/neil_l_andersen_missionary_baptism.png 250w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/01/9f/019f3e7ba700157990b1c76af820ef491f523b37/neil_l_andersen_missionary_baptism.png 320w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/21/2a/212a6e27f4fde534d123ea50127fc8d9c725b5d4/neil_l_andersen_missionary_baptism.png 500w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/d8/e5/d8e5e946242be3ee7913a73305241b5787d7e314/neil_l_andersen_missionary_baptism.png 640w\" data-assetid=\"13c218f16e8a744651c5e56a2ab5020eb7330a34\" data-missing-asset=\"false\">\n<p data-aid=\"143138620\" id=\"p24\">In a seemingly ordinary moment, at a door much like hundreds of other doors, I had felt the power of heaven.

He would have to stand before God and acknowledge that these events in the Sacred Grove actually happened in his life and that his life could never be the same because of it. About 25 years ago, I first heard a variation of this phrase by Elder Neal&#xA0;A. Maxwell. He gave this example: &#x201C;Long ago in May 1945 there was such a moment for me on the island of Okinawa at age eighteen. There was certainly no heroism on my part but rather a blessing for me and others during the shelling of our position by Japanese artillery. After repeated shellings which overshot our position, the enemy artillery finally zeroed in. They should have then fired for effect, but there was a divine response to at least one frightened, selfish prayer. The shelling halted. &#x2026; I had been blessed, and I knew that God knew that I knew&#x201D; (&#x201C;<a class=\"cross-ref\" href=\"/study/ensign/1996/06/becoming-a-disciple?lang=eng\">Becoming a Disciple<\/a>,&#x201D; <cite>Ensign,<\/cite> June 1996, 19).<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143139808\" id=\"note5_p2\">Elder Maxwell added not only that he knew, and not only that God knew, but that God knew that he knew he had been blessed. Symbolically for me this raises the accountability a step higher. At times, our Heavenly Father accompanies a blessing given to us with an intense spiritual confirmation that the heavens intervened on our behalf. There is no denying it. It stays with us, and if we are honest and faithful, it will shape our life in the coming years. &#x201C;I had been blessed, and I knew that God knew that I knew that I had been blessed.&#x201D;<\/p>",
