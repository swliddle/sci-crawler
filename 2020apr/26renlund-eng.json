Renlund<\/p>\n<p class=\"author-role\" data-aid=\"143139462\" id=\"author2\">Of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"kicker\" data-aid=\"143139464\" id=\"kicker1\">I invite you to remember each day the greatness of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ and what They have done for you.<\/p>\n<\/header>\n<div class=\"body-block\">\n<p data-aid=\"143139467\" id=\"p1\">Throughout time, even and especially during difficult times, prophets have encouraged us to remember the greatness of God and to consider what He has done for us as individuals, as families, and as a people.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\">1<\/sup><\/a> This direction is found throughout the scriptures but is notably prominent in the Book of Mormon. The title page explains that one of the Book of Mormon\u2019s purposes is \u201cto show unto the remnant of the house of Israel what great things the Lord hath done for their fathers.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\">2<\/sup><\/a> The Book of Mormon\u2019s conclusion includes Moroni\u2019s appeal: \u201cBehold, I would exhort you that when ye shall read these things \u2026 that ye would remember how merciful the Lord hath been unto the children of men \u2026 and ponder it in your hearts.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\">3<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143139470\" id=\"p2\">The consistency of pleas from prophets to reflect on the goodness of God is striking.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\">4<\/sup><\/a> Our Heavenly Father wants us to recall His and His Beloved Son\u2019s goodness, not for Their own gratification but for the influence such remembrance has on us. By considering Their kindness, our perspective and understanding are enlarged. By reflecting on Their compassion, we become more humble, prayerful, and steadfast.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143139473\" id=\"p3\">A poignant experience with a former patient shows how gratitude for generosity and compassion can transform us. In 1987, I became acquainted with Thomas Nielson, a remarkable man who needed a heart transplant. He was 63 years old and lived in Logan, Utah, in the United States. Following military service during World War II, he married Donna Wilkes in the Logan Utah Temple. He became an energetic and successful brick mason. In later years he especially enjoyed working with his oldest grandchild, Jonathan, during school vacations. The two developed a special bond, in part because Tom saw much of himself in Jonathan.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143139476\" id=\"p4\">Tom found waiting for a donor heart frustrating. He was not a particularly patient man. He had always been able to set and achieve goals through hard work and sheer determination. Struggling with heart failure, with his life on hold, Tom sometimes asked me what I was doing to speed up the process. Jokingly, he suggested avenues I could pursue that would make a donor heart available to him sooner.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143139481\" id=\"p5\">One joyous yet dreadful day, an ideal donor heart became available for Tom. The size and blood type were a match, and the donor was young, just 16 years old. The donor heart belonged to Jonathan, Tom\u2019s beloved grandson. Earlier that day, Jonathan had been fatally injured when the car in which he was riding was struck by a passing train.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143139485\" id=\"p6\">When I visited Tom and Donna in the hospital, they were distraught. It is hard to imagine what they were going through, knowing that Tom\u2019s life could be extended by using their grandson\u2019s heart. At first, they refused to consider the proffered heart from Jonathan\u2019s grieving parents, their daughter and son-in-law. Tom and Donna knew, though, that <span class=\"page-break\" data-page=\"42\"><\/span>Jonathan was brain dead, and came to understand that their prayers for a donor heart for Tom had not caused Jonathan\u2019s accident. No, Jonathan\u2019s heart was a gift that could bless Tom in his time of need. They recognized that something good might come out of this tragedy and decided to proceed.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143139489\" id=\"p7\">The transplant procedures went well. Afterward, Tom was a different man. The change went beyond improved health or even gratitude. He told me that he reflected every morning on Jonathan, on his daughter and son-in-law, on the gift he had received, and on what that gift had entailed. Even though his innate good humor and grit were still readily apparent, I observed that Tom was more solemn, thoughtful, and kindhearted.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143139493\" id=\"p8\">Tom lived an additional 13 years after the transplant, years he otherwise would not have had. His obituary stated that these years allowed him to touch the lives of his family and others with generosity and love. He was a private benefactor and an example of optimism and determination.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143139498\" id=\"p9\">Much like Tom, each of us has received gifts that we could not provide for ourselves, gifts from our Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son, including redemption through the atoning sacrifice of Jesus Christ.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\">5<\/sup><\/a> We have received life in this world; we will receive physical life in the hereafter, and eternal salvation and exaltation\u2014if we choose it\u2014all because of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143139502\" id=\"p10\">Every time we use, benefit from, or even think of these gifts, we ought to consider the sacrifice, generosity, and compassion of the givers. Reverence for the givers does more than just make us grateful. Reflecting on Their gifts can and should transform us.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143139505\" id=\"p11\">One remarkable transformation was that of Alma the Younger. As Alma was \u201cgoing about rebelling against God,\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\">6<\/sup><\/a> an angel appeared. With \u201ca voice of thunder,\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\">7<\/sup><\/a> the angel chastised Alma for persecuting the Church and \u201cstealing away the hearts of the people.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\">8<\/sup><\/a> The angel added this admonition: \u201cGo, and remember the captivity of thy fathers \u2026 ; and remember how great things [God] has done for them.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\">9<\/sup><\/a> Of all possible exhortations, that was what the angel emphasized.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143139508\" id=\"p28\">Alma repented and remembered. He later shared the angel\u2019s admonition with his son Helaman. Alma counseled, \u201cI would that ye should do as I have done, in remembering the captivity of our fathers; for they were in bondage, and none could deliver them except it was the God of Abraham, \u2026 Isaac, and \u2026 Jacob; and he surely did deliver them in their afflictions.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\">10<\/sup><\/a> Alma said simply, \u201cI do put my trust in him.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\">11<\/sup><\/a> Alma understood that by remembering deliverance from bondage and support during \u201ctrials and troubles of every kind,\u201d we come to know God and the surety of His promises.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\">12<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143139511\" id=\"p29\">Few of us have an experience as dramatic as Alma\u2019s, yet our transformation can be equally profound. The Savior pledged anciently:<\/p>\n<span class=\"page-break\" data-page=\"43\"><\/span>\n<p data-aid=\"143139513\" id=\"p23\">\u201cA new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart \u2026 , and I will give you an heart of flesh.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143139516\" id=\"p24\">\u201cAnd I will put my spirit within you. \u2026<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143139520\" id=\"p25\">\u201c\u2026 And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\">13<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143139526\" id=\"p12\">The resurrected Savior told the Nephites how this transformation begins. He identified a pivotal feature in Heavenly Father\u2019s plan when He said:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143139529\" id=\"p26\">\u201cAnd my Father sent me that I might be lifted up upon the cross; and after that I had been lifted up upon the cross, that I might <em>draw<\/em> all men unto me. \u2026<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143139532\" id=\"p27\">\u201cAnd for this cause have I been lifted up; therefore, according to the power of the Father I will <em>draw<\/em> all men unto me.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note14\"><sup class=\"marker\">14<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143139536\" id=\"p13\">What does it take for you to be drawn to the Savior? Consider Jesus Christ\u2019s submission to His Father\u2019s will, His victory over death, His taking upon Himself your sins and mistakes, His receiving power from the Father to make intercession for you, and His ultimate redemption of you.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note15\"><sup class=\"marker\">15<\/sup><\/a> Are these things not sufficient to draw you to Him? They are for me. Jesus Christ \u201cstands with open arms, hoping and willing to heal, forgive, cleanse, strengthen, purify, and sanctify [you and me].\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note16\"><sup class=\"marker\">16<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143139540\" id=\"p14\">These truths should give us a new heart and prompt us to choose to follow Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ. Yet even new hearts may be \u201cprone to wander, \u2026 prone to leave the God [we] love.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note17\"><sup class=\"marker\">17<\/sup><\/a> To fight this tendency, we need to reflect every day on the gifts we have received and on what they entailed. King Benjamin counseled, \u201cI would that ye should remember, and always retain in remembrance, the greatness of God \u2026 and his goodness and long-suffering towards you.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note18\"><sup class=\"marker\">18<\/sup><\/a> If we do so, we qualify for remarkable heavenly blessings.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143139544\" id=\"p15\">Reflecting on God\u2019s goodness and mercy helps us become more spiritually receptive. In turn, increased spiritual sensitivity allows us to come to know the truth of all things by the power of the Holy Ghost.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note19\"><sup class=\"marker\">19<\/sup><\/a> This includes a testimony of the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon; knowing that Jesus is the Christ, our personal Savior and Redeemer; and accepting that His gospel has been restored in these latter days.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note20\"><sup class=\"marker\">20<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143139548\" id=\"p16\">When we remember the greatness of our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ and what They have done for us, we will not take Them for granted, just as Tom did not take Jonathan\u2019s heart for granted. In a joyful and reverent way, Tom remembered each day the tragedy that brought him extended life. In the exuberance of knowing that we can be saved and exalted, we need to remember that salvation and exaltation came at a great cost.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note21\"><sup class=\"marker\">21<\/sup><\/a> We can be reverently joyful as we realize that without Jesus Christ, we are doomed, but with Him, we can receive the greatest gift Heavenly Father can give.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note22\"><sup class=\"marker\">22<\/sup><\/a> Indeed, this reverence allows us to enjoy the promise \u201cof eternal life in this world\u201d and eventually receive \u201ceternal life \u2026 even immortal glory\u201d in the world to come.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note23\"><sup class=\"marker\">23<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143139552\" id=\"p17\">When we consider the goodness of our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, our trust in Them increases. Our prayers change because we know God is our Father and we are His children. We seek not to change His will but to align our will with His and secure for ourselves blessings that He wants to grant, conditioned on our asking for them.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note24\"><sup class=\"marker\">24<\/sup><\/a> We yearn to be more meek, more pure, more steadfast, more Christlike.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note25\"><sup class=\"marker\">25<\/sup><\/a> These changes qualify us for additional heavenly blessings.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143139557\" id=\"p18\">By acknowledging that every good thing comes from Jesus Christ, we will communicate our faith more effectively to others.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note26\"><sup class=\"marker\">26<\/sup><\/a> We will have courage when confronted with seemingly impossible tasks and circumstances.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note27\"><sup class=\"marker\">27<\/sup><\/a> We will strengthen our resolve to keep the covenants we have made to follow the Savior.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note28\"><sup class=\"marker\">28<\/sup><\/a> We will be filled with the love of God, want to help those in need without being judgmental, love our children and raise them in righteousness, retain a remission of our sins, and always rejoice.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note29\"><sup class=\"marker\">29<\/sup><\/a> These are the remarkable <span class=\"page-break\" data-page=\"44\"><\/span>fruits of remembering God\u2019s goodness and mercy.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143139562\" id=\"p19\">In contrast, the Savior warned, \u201cIn nothing doth man offend God, or against none is his wrath kindled, save those who confess not his hand in all things.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note30\"><sup class=\"marker\">30<\/sup><\/a> I do not think that God is insulted when we forget Him. Rather, I think He is deeply disappointed. He knows that we have deprived ourselves of the opportunity to draw closer to Him by remembering Him and His goodness. We then miss out on Him drawing nearer to us and the specific blessings He has promised.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note31\"><sup class=\"marker\">31<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143139567\" id=\"p20\">I invite you to remember each day the greatness of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ and what They have done for you. Let your consideration of Their goodness more firmly bind your wandering heart to Them.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note32\"><sup class=\"marker\">32<\/sup><\/a> Ponder Their compassion, and you will be blessed with added spiritual sensitivity and become more Christlike. Contemplating Their empathy will help you \u201chold out faithful to the end,\u201d until you \u201care received into heaven\u201d to \u201cdwell with God in a state of never-ending happiness.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note33\"><sup class=\"marker\">33<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143139569\" id=\"p21\">Our Heavenly Father, referring to His Beloved Son, said, \u201cHear Him!\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note34\"><sup class=\"marker\">34<\/sup><\/a> As you act on those words and listen to Him, remember, joyfully and reverently, that the Savior loves to restore what you cannot restore; He loves to heal wounds you cannot heal; He loves to fix what has been irreparably broken;<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note35\"><sup class=\"marker\">35<\/sup><\/a> He compensates for any unfairness inflicted on you;<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note36\"><sup class=\"marker\">36<\/sup><\/a> and He loves to permanently mend even shattered hearts.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note37\"><sup class=\"marker\">37<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143139574\" id=\"p22\">As I have reflected on gifts from our Heavenly Father and from Jesus Christ, I have come to know of Their infinite love and Their incomprehensible compassion for all Heavenly Father\u2019s children.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note38\"><sup class=\"marker\">38<\/sup><\/a> This knowledge has changed me, and it will change you too.
