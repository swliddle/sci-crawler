In that light, Joseph Smith saw God the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ. Their light drove back the spiritual darkness that covered the earth and pointed the way forward for Joseph Smith\u2014and for all of us. Because of the light revealed that day, we can receive the fulness of blessings available through the Atonement of our Savior, Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143140170\" id=\"p2\">By virtue of the Restoration of His gospel, we can be filled with the light of our Savior. However, that light is not meant for you and me alone. Jesus Christ has called upon us to \u201clet your light so shine before this people, that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\">1<\/sup><\/a> I have come to love the phrase \u201cthat they may see.\u201d It is an earnest invitation from the Lord to be more intentional about helping others see the path and thereby come unto Christ.<\/p>\n<img id=\"img2\" src=\"https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/04/aa/04aa6355f7459967df038021d0c695a76994e61b/l_tom_perry_portrait.png\" data-img-id=\"2349988\" srcset=\"https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/19/2d/192d102d924decceff1120e4ffdd2c2717209495/l_tom_perry_portrait.png 60w,https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/1e/87/1e87908a6e9564eab269d8d1ca3db9a036083945/l_tom_perry_portrait.png 100w,https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/61/7f/617fda6b7617141ce6fcba09abd7c6f763617bd0/l_tom_perry_portrait.png 200w,https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/cc/63/cc6392fd17dbabb53117781b9f2e96452acc949a/l_tom_perry_portrait.png 250w,https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/70/d3/70d39a6af67f661f21ad3a2e7c3cfa0a98c7c0cb/l_tom_perry_portrait.png 320w,https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/04/aa/04aa6355f7459967df038021d0c695a76994e61b/l_tom_perry_portrait.png 500w,https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/b3/3b/b33ba7ee49f6a47b17d98ea0ca61da1ba9a1d135/l_tom_perry_portrait.png 640w\" data-assetId=\"bb1e35ff93954cf7d54cce79e14fb07dd86ede09\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"775\" data-aspect-ratio=\"0.6451612903225806\" alt=\"L. Tom Perry\"/>\n<p data-aid=\"143140172\" id=\"p3\">When I was 10 years old, our family had the honor of hosting Elder L. Tom Perry of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles while he was on assignment in my hometown.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143140174\" id=\"p4\">At the close of the day, our family and the Perrys sat down in our living room to enjoy my mother\u2019s delicious apple pie while Elder Perry recounted stories about Saints around the world. I was enthralled.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143140176\" id=\"p5\">It was getting late when my mother called me into the kitchen and asked a simple question: \u201cBonnie, did you feed the chickens?\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143140178\" id=\"p6\">My heart fell; I had not. Not wanting to leave the presence of an Apostle of the Lord, I suggested the chickens could fast until morning.<\/p>\n<span class=\"page-break\" data-page=\"79\"><\/span>\n<p data-aid=\"143140179\" id=\"p7\">My mother replied with a definitive \u201cno.\u201d Just then, Elder Perry entered the kitchen and with his booming, enthusiastic voice asked, \u201cDid I hear someone needs to feed the chickens? Can my son and I join you?\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143140181\" id=\"p8\">Oh, what an absolute joy it now became to feed the chickens! I ran to get our large yellow flashlight. Excited, I led out, skipping over the well-worn path to the chicken coop. With flashlight swinging from my hand, we crossed the corn patch and passed through the wheat field.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143140182\" id=\"p9\">Reaching the small irrigation ditch that crossed the path, I instinctively jumped over it as I had done many nights before. I was oblivious to Elder Perry\u2019s efforts to keep up on a dark, unknown path. My dancing light did not help him see the ditch. Without a steady light to see, he stepped directly in the water and let out a loud groan. Panicked, I turned to see my new friend remove his soaking wet foot from the ditch and shaking the water from his heavy leather shoe.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143140183\" id=\"p10\">With a soaked and sloshing shoe, Elder Perry helped me feed the chickens. When we were through, he lovingly instructed, \u201cBonnie, I need to see the path. I need the light to shine where I am walking.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143140185\" id=\"p11\">I was shining my light but not in a way that would help Elder Perry. Now, knowing that he needed my light to safely navigate the path, I focused the flashlight just ahead of his steps and we were able to return home with confidence.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143140187\" id=\"p12\">My dear brothers and sisters, for years I\u2019ve pondered the principle I learned from Elder Perry. The Lord\u2019s invitation to let our light so shine is not just about randomly waving a beam of light and making the world generally brighter. It is about focusing our light so others may see the way to Christ. It is gathering Israel <em>on this side of the veil<\/em>\u2014helping others see the next step forward in making and keeping sacred covenants with God.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\">2<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143140189\" id=\"p13\">The Savior testified, \u201cBehold I am the light; I have set an example for you.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\">3<\/sup><\/a> Let\u2019s look at one of His examples.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143140191\" id=\"p14\">The woman at the well was a Samaritan who did not know Jesus Christ and was viewed by many as an outcast in her own society. Jesus met her and initiated a conversation. He spoke to her of water. He then led her to increased light as He declared Himself to be the \u201cliving water.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\">4<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143140194\" id=\"p15\">Christ was compassionately aware of her and her needs. He met the woman where she was and started by talking about something familiar and common. If He had stopped there, it would have been a positive encounter. But it would not have resulted in her going to the city to proclaim, \u201cCome, see \u2026 : is not this the Christ?\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\">5<\/sup><\/a> Gradually, through the conversation, she discovered Jesus Christ, and despite her past, she became an instrument of light, shining the way for others to see.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\">6<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143140196\" id=\"p16\">Now let\u2019s look at two people who followed the Savior\u2019s example of shining light. Recently my friend Kevin was seated next to a business executive at dinner. He worried what to talk about for two hours. Following a prompting, Kevin asked, \u201cTell me about your family. Where do they come from?\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143140198\" id=\"p17\">The gentleman knew little about his heritage, so Kevin pulled out his phone, saying, \u201cI have an app that connects people to their families. Let\u2019s see what we can find.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143140200\" id=\"p18\">After a lengthy discussion, Kevin\u2019s new friend asked, \u201cWhy is family so important to your church?\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143140202\" id=\"p19\">Kevin answered simply, \u201cWe believe that we continue to live after we die. If we identify our ancestors and take their names to a sacred place <span class=\"page-break\" data-page=\"80\"><\/span>called a temple, we can perform marriage ordinances that will keep our families together even after death.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\">7<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143140203\" id=\"p20\">Kevin started with something he and his new friend had in common. He then found a way to witness of the Savior\u2019s light and love.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143140208\" id=\"p21\">The second story is about Ella, a collegiate basketball player. Her example began when she received her mission call while away at school. She chose to open her call in front of her team. They knew almost nothing about the Church of Jesus Christ and didn\u2019t understand Ella\u2019s desire to serve. She prayed repeatedly to know how to explain her mission call in a way that her teammates might feel the Spirit. Her answer?<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143140211\" id=\"p22\">\u201cI made a PowerPoint,\u201d Ella said, \u201cbecause I\u2019m just that cool.\u201d She told them about the potential of serving in one of 400-plus missions and possibly learning a language.
