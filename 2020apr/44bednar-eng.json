From Them, Joseph learned about the true nature of the Godhead and of ongoing revelation as this supernal vision ushered in the latter-day \u201cdispensation of the fulness of times.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\">1<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143140197\" id=\"p2\">Approximately three years later, in response to earnest prayer on the evening of September 21, 1823, Joseph\u2019s bedroom filled with light until it was \u201clighter than at noonday.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\">2<\/sup><\/a> A personage appeared at his bedside, called the young boy by name, and declared \u201che was a messenger sent from the presence of God \u2026 and that his name was Moroni.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\">3<\/sup><\/a> He instructed Joseph about the coming forth of the Book of Mormon.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143140199\" id=\"p3\">And then Moroni quoted from the book of Malachi in the Old Testament, with a little variation in the language used in the King James Version:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143140201\" id=\"p40\">\u201cBehold, I will reveal unto you the Priesthood, by the hand of Elijah the prophet, before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord. \u2026<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"143140205\" id=\"p41\">\u201cAnd he shall plant in the hearts of the children the promises made to the fathers, and the hearts of the children <span class=\"page-break\" data-page=\"85\"><\/span>shall turn to their fathers.

This simple but significant word often denotes the inner feelings of an individual. Our hearts\u2014the sum total of our desires, affections, intentions, motives, and attitudes\u2014define who we are and determine what we will become.
