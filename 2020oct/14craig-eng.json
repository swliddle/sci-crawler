Early one morning the young man woke up, went outside, and found the city surrounded by a great army intent on destroying them. He ran to Elisha: &#x201C;Alas, my master! how shall we do?&#x201D;<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"144618611\" id=\"p2\">Elisha answered, &#x201C;Fear not: for they that be with us are more than they that be with them.&#x201D;<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"144618613\" id=\"p22\">Elisha knew the young man needed more than calming reassurance; he needed vision. And so &#x201C;Elisha prayed, &#x2026; Lord, &#x2026; open his eyes, that he may see. And the Lord opened the eyes of the young man; and he saw: and, behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Elisha.&#x201D;<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\">1<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"144618615\" id=\"p3\">There may be times when you, like the servant, find yourself struggling to see how God is working in your life&#xFEFF;&#x2014;times when <em>you<\/em> feel under siege&#xFEFF;&#x2014;when the trials of mortality bring you to your knees.

Columnist David Brooks said: &#x201C;Many of our society&#x2019;s great problems flow from people not feeling seen and known. &#x2026; [There is a] core &#x2026; trait that we all have to get &#x2026; better at[, and that] is the trait of seeing each other deeply and being deeply seen.&#x201D;<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\">3<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"144618627\" id=\"p6\">Jesus Christ sees people deeply. He sees individuals, their needs, and who they can become.

I pulled out my phone and then remembered the impression I had received. I put my phone away and looked around. I saw an elderly gentleman in line ahead of me. His cart was empty except for a few cans of cat food. I felt a little awkward but said something <em>really<\/em> clever like, &#x201C;I can see you have a cat.&#x201D; He said that a storm was coming, and he did not want to be caught without cat food. We visited briefly, and then he turned to me and said, &#x201C;You know, I haven&#x2019;t told anyone this, but today is my birthday.&#x201D; My heart melted. I wished him a happy birthday and offered a silent prayer of thanks that I had not been on my phone and missed an opportunity to truly see and connect with another person who needed it.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"144618641\" id=\"p11\">With all of my heart I do not want to be like the priest or the Levite on the road to Jericho&#xFEFF;&#x2014;one who looks and passes by.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\">7<\/sup><\/a> But too often I think I am.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"144618643\" id=\"title5\">Seeing God&#x2019;s Errand for Me<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"144618646\" id=\"p12\">I recently learned a valuable lesson about seeing deeply from a young woman named Rozlyn.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"144618649\" id=\"p13\">The story was shared with me by my friend who was devastated when her husband of 20 years moved out. With her children splitting time between parents, the prospect of attending church alone seemed daunting. She recounts:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"144618653\" id=\"p14\">&#x201C;In a church where the family is of paramount importance, sitting solo can be painful. That first Sunday I walked in praying no one would speak to me. I was barely holding it together, and tears were on the brink. I sat in my typical spot, hoping no one would notice how empty the bench seemed.<\/p>\n<span class=\"page-break\" data-page=\"17\"><\/span>\n<p data-aid=\"144618657\" id=\"p15\">&#x201C;A young woman in our ward turned and looked at me. I pretended to smile. She smiled back. I could see the concern in her face. I silently pleaded that she wouldn&#x2019;t come to talk to me&#xFEFF;&#x2014;I had nothing positive to say and knew I would cry. I looked back down at my lap and avoided eye contact.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"144618661\" id=\"p16\">&#x201C;During the next hour, I noticed her looking back at me occasionally. As soon as the meeting ended, she made a beeline for me. &#x2018;Hi, Rozlyn,&#x2019; I whispered. She wrapped me in her arms and said, &#x2018;Sister Smith, I can tell today is a bad day for you. I&#x2019;m so sorry. I love you.&#x2019; As predicted, the tears came as she hugged me again. But as I walked away, I thought to myself, &#x2018;Maybe I can do this after all.&#x2019;<\/p>\n<img id=\"img1\" src=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/a7/a9/a7a90cd5b2dd3b2b4d2a1f3de4b5b0569a5406fb/friends_kindred_spirits.png\" data-img-id=\"80f74e03efc2754bf2ed7bcb98514b3bdf30516c\" srcset=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/7a/45/7a45e65de85a1b38eb441409107078aac0f3473c/friends_kindred_spirits.png 60w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/77/f8/77f892004bb4e82929e07dd235c43a2f0b2ad3a4/friends_kindred_spirits.png 100w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/09/e2/09e29413a2b34a4268729913a7404db000161f9e/friends_kindred_spirits.png 200w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/9f/e0/9fe0bed15211cc9a0879c589015274e9e9cccaa0/friends_kindred_spirits.png 250w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/85/32/853203d9029e989b695e07d6a948a51eda7f5e6f/friends_kindred_spirits.png 320w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/a7/a9/a7a90cd5b2dd3b2b4d2a1f3de4b5b0569a5406fb/friends_kindred_spirits.png 500w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/d5/1e/d51e09efbab9c60389cf73cd97e2fe9e3c9c2044/friends_kindred_spirits.png 640w\" data-assetid=\"80f74e03efc2754bf2ed7bcb98514b3bdf30516c\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" alt=\"Two women\">\n<p data-aid=\"144618663\" id=\"p17\">&#x201C;That sweet 16-year-old young woman, less than half my age, found me every Sunday for the rest of that year to give me a hug and ask, &#x2018;How are you?&#x2019; It made such a difference in how I felt about coming to church.

She needed more than calming reassurance; she needed vision. She felt a question pierce her heart: &#x201C;Why did you do those things? Did you do them for the reward, the praise of others, or the desired outcome?&#x201D; She hesitated for a moment, searched her heart, and was then able to answer confidently, &#x201C;I did them because I love the Savior.
