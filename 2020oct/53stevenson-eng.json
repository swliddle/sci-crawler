Kimball would be visiting Asia and that all members and missionaries in Japan were invited to Tokyo to hear the prophet at an area conference. With branch members, my companion and I excitedly began making plans for the conference, which would require a 12-hour boat ride across the East China Sea to mainland Japan, followed by a 15-hour train ride to Tokyo. Sadly, however, it was not to be. We received word from our mission president that because of distance and time, my companion and I would not be able to attend the conference in Tokyo.<\/p>\n<img id=\"img1\" src=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/6d/5d/6d5d193357ff0270fb905ea1f3571ddf5b8ee975/gary_stevenson_mission.png\" data-img-id=\"c6cc0f6943653d47c8120ea002f0ccf39e730f7d\" srcset=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/f3/61/f361d89b38374d3465e619b538505f311bdfa218/gary_stevenson_mission.png 60w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/78/11/78116785b4613ad102d120a513ae54701694ee22/gary_stevenson_mission.png 100w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/e1/41/e14163e973c12de9aeef9c4ccd3eb4eca283cae7/gary_stevenson_mission.png 200w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/57/8b/578b48545b0c6336027f239a890413f3b8002dbe/gary_stevenson_mission.png 250w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/2d/5e/2d5ef2f428962b7bdea7956e4ca750360dc81a8f/gary_stevenson_mission.png 320w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/6d/5d/6d5d193357ff0270fb905ea1f3571ddf5b8ee975/gary_stevenson_mission.png 500w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/d5/2d/d52d4db01747951eb8dbf58b2c2c1d52fe09dd88/gary_stevenson_mission.png 640w\" data-assetid=\"c6cc0f6943653d47c8120ea002f0ccf39e730f7d\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" alt=\"Gary Stevenson\">\n<p data-aid=\"144620167\" id=\"p2\">While members of our little branch embarked for Tokyo, we stayed behind.

They gushed with excitement as they shared the fulfillment of their dream. They described how, upon hearing the temple announcement, members and missionaries were unable to contain their joy and spontaneously erupted into clapping their hands.<\/p>\n<img id=\"img3\" src=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/5f/56/5f56e6818906ea0379687a11f6ca7ed51d18c5e8/spencer_w_kimball.png\" data-img-id=\"57eaf1d5de63774fccd08e3f5256a87799f040d2\" srcset=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/83/9c/839cea160d554a550db64fe1d842b28a9977bdc7/spencer_w_kimball.png 60w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/8a/fe/8afe6e12368c90446c1713175ca3770aae94cd1e/spencer_w_kimball.png 100w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/32/7f/327f9233e15a29f4fe1df5a3cc10ffd5a6295b29/spencer_w_kimball.png 200w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/99/d3/99d302d32fb33c48927026cfd7e26e0ef4d92930/spencer_w_kimball.png 250w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/7e/b5/7eb583f69ab43525d1a80d2ebfb6d4d24a21c1be/spencer_w_kimball.png 320w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/5f/56/5f56e6818906ea0379687a11f6ca7ed51d18c5e8/spencer_w_kimball.png 500w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/da/c0/dac01c231c31cf5ee38770e6ffaef118fc0c6627/spencer_w_kimball.png 640w\" data-assetid=\"57eaf1d5de63774fccd08e3f5256a87799f040d2\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" alt=\"Spencer W.

Thousands of you were preparing to enter the temple for living ordinances&#xFEFF;&#x2014;including temple sealings.

As he looked back on his life and ministry, he offered an important reflection in the very first verse of the Book of Mormon. This verse frames an important principle for us to consider in our time. Following his familiar words, &#x201C;I, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents&#xA0;&#x2026;&#xA0;,&#x201D; he writes, &#x201C;and having seen many afflictions in the course of my days, nevertheless, having been highly favored of the Lord in all my days.&#x201D;<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\">3<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"144620197\" id=\"p11\">As students of the Book of Mormon, we are familiar with the many afflictions to which Nephi refers. Yet following acknowledgment of his afflictions in the course of his days, Nephi gives his gospel perspective of being highly favored of the Lord in all his days. Times of affliction and disappointment do not change the watchful eye of the Lord as He favorably looks upon us, blessing us.<\/p>\n<img id=\"img5\" src=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/38/91/3891c63124150f77937d6817c9e501f949883856/mission_meeting_room.png\" data-img-id=\"fe7da5b5c3a21f389044ac18546676f7b176e81b\" srcset=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/50/06/50060438aea6adc541acc772f732297a9aad8269/mission_meeting_room.png 60w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/c0/59/c059c004d0d6e616cf812fdd1c1e35bb2fbdc708/mission_meeting_room.png 100w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/24/83/2483161ebb871366c630e46c9ab24e24c4ac3eef/mission_meeting_room.png 200w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/a1/a6/a1a64c663c4f9c4f7e861d7aad9895bb93a44774/mission_meeting_room.png 250w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/12/94/1294c8605ca730f26ff67fab669cfd8a3427a045/mission_meeting_room.png 320w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/38/91/3891c63124150f77937d6817c9e501f949883856/mission_meeting_room.png 500w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/53/b3/53b3769995a7648dfb28bc7c8282e2b2d52de2f6/mission_meeting_room.png 640w\" data-assetid=\"fe7da5b5c3a21f389044ac18546676f7b176e81b\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" alt=\"Mission Meeting\">\n<img id=\"img6\" src=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/d0/3d/d03d0d0e45c75ca45d5a845edb8606837ce7b894/mission_meeting_missionaries.png\" data-img-id=\"1fe1bb6e631ae6e0f63249b79995917e8777e068\" srcset=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/51/e3/51e3ea31813e189a5a8e804c6e0c3c66690890c6/mission_meeting_missionaries.png 60w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/17/10/1710dd11045abbc41dc0978c1b34f00e2d526af6/mission_meeting_missionaries.png 100w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/72/86/7286bd9d012589cda3c08aca9818bba1c75adf35/mission_meeting_missionaries.png 200w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/33/f0/33f087063ea9f56e0c0313ce4ceede27944db9c4/mission_meeting_missionaries.png 250w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/26/16/2616446e36f9b057f7d3ab98c70669ddfd9ee2c5/mission_meeting_missionaries.png 320w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/d0/3d/d03d0d0e45c75ca45d5a845edb8606837ce7b894/mission_meeting_missionaries.png 500w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/1e/cc/1ecc7f7164c944d61b8914646e91c2aa27e60aee/mission_meeting_missionaries.png 640w\" data-assetid=\"1fe1bb6e631ae6e0f63249b79995917e8777e068\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" alt=\"Mission Meeting\">\n<img id=\"img7\" src=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/97/18/97188c36a884b4bda30e38c45357240f2fce90b0/mission_meeting_missionaries.png\" data-img-id=\"50269197c37b6a6014250d0822c98d3a9425b36b\" srcset=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/fb/2f/fb2f7fea7bda4713996a2a3f7f59c001217839d3/mission_meeting_missionaries.png 60w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/fb/86/fb864515c29d9e2b9346fbec72a7f9a24f49d7ea/mission_meeting_missionaries.png 100w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/04/9e/049e2cf2d68c585a70e9df723beb675a86381865/mission_meeting_missionaries.png 200w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/06/73/0673782aaa05067f64647f76c721616b666f2135/mission_meeting_missionaries.png 250w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/6a/07/6a07609e0834b8a2eec68c5763cfc73379b25b7d/mission_meeting_missionaries.png 320w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/97/18/97188c36a884b4bda30e38c45357240f2fce90b0/mission_meeting_missionaries.png 500w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/11/46/1146b08a7b0aded6ad1d352c4a641b0c19967d53/mission_meeting_missionaries.png 640w\" data-assetid=\"50269197c37b6a6014250d0822c98d3a9425b36b\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" alt=\"Mission Meeting\">\n<p data-aid=\"144620201\" id=\"p12\">Lesa and I recently met virtually with about 600 missionaries in Australia, most of whom were under some measure of confinement or restriction related to COVID-19, many working from their apartments.

With little hope for success, her family contacted temple president Michael Vellinga to see if there was any way the miracle they had been praying for could be realized. Their fasting and prayers were answered!<\/p>\n<img id=\"img14\" src=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/a8/45/a845eeb89cab0580b63b2db22e2599653252bb16/family_life_temple.png\" data-img-id=\"c07e98f309e82c1aaea26e30f4a5503e2205337e\" srcset=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/5b/dc/5bdc5158749525660b3386a68b224a7351a12953/family_life_temple.png 60w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/a1/d8/a1d8cc515702fcb0d3638b61cbcafb7302e0ecd3/family_life_temple.png 100w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/6f/64/6f643d6ec67bcf0a09a495061dc82fd13ca1d92f/family_life_temple.png 200w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/47/dd/47dd74666d86f0d407d1fe571c2c3253594c0668/family_life_temple.png 250w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/1a/f3/1af314aeafa12f454891df4620078b57ae37785f/family_life_temple.png 320w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/a8/45/a845eeb89cab0580b63b2db22e2599653252bb16/family_life_temple.png 500w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/cf/3f/cf3fcbde39617eb99a90fe7278d8a2f82c2d4f1e/family_life_temple.png 640w\" data-assetid=\"c07e98f309e82c1aaea26e30f4a5503e2205337e\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" alt=\"Family Life\">\n<p data-aid=\"144620261\" id=\"p30\">At 2:00 a.m., hours before her flight departure, Sister Palmer and her family, in tears, were greeted at the temple doors by the smiling temple president with the words, &#x201C;Good morning, Palmer family.

I believe that in this life, and in the life to come, your afflictions, your Ammonihah, your Liberty Jail, will be consecrated for your gain.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note15\"><sup class=\"marker\">15<\/sup><\/a> I pray that, along with Nephi, we can acknowledge the afflictions in the course of our days while at the same time recognizing that we are highly favored of the Lord.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"144620278\" id=\"p36\">I close with my testimony of Jesus Christ, who Himself was no stranger to affliction and as part of His infinite Atonement descended below all things.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note16\"><sup class=\"marker\">16<\/sup><\/a> He understands our grief, pain, and desperation. He is our Savior, our Redeemer, our hope, our consolation, and our Deliverer. Of this I testify in His holy name, Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n<\/div>",
