<p data-aid="144618905" id="p1">Dear brothers and sisters, I recently officiated in a temple sealing, following COVID-19 guidelines. With the bride and groom, both faithful returned missionaries, were their parents and all their siblings. This was not easy. The bride is the ninth of ten children. Her nine siblings sat in order, oldest to youngest, socially distanced of course.</p>
<p data-aid="144618907" id="p2">The family had sought to be good neighbors wherever they lived. However, one community had been unwelcoming&#xFEFF;&#x2014;because, the bride&#x2019;s mother said, their family were members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</p>
<p data-aid="144618909" id="p3">The family did everything to make friends at school, contribute, and be accepted, but to no avail. The family prayed and prayed hearts would soften.</p>
<p data-aid="144618911" id="p4">One night, the family felt their prayers were answered, though in a very unexpected way. Their house caught fire and burned to the ground. But something else happened. The fire softened their neighbors&#x2019; hearts.</p>
<p data-aid="144618913" id="p5">Their neighbors and local school gathered clothes, shoes, and other necessities needed by the family, who had lost everything. Kindness opened understanding. It was not the way the family hoped or expected their prayers to be answered. However, they express gratitude for what they learned through hard experiences and unexpected answers to heartfelt prayers.</p>
<p data-aid="144618915" id="p6">Truly, for those with faithful hearts and eyes to see, the Lord&#x2019;s tender mercies are manifest amidst life&#x2019;s challenges. Faithfully met challenges and sacrifice do bring the blessings of heaven. In this mortality, we may lose or wait for some things for a time, but in the end we will find what matters most.<a class="note-ref" href="#note1"><sup class="marker">1</sup></a> That is His promise.<a class="note-ref" href="#note2"><sup class="marker">2</sup></a></p>
<p data-aid="144618916" id="p7">Our 2020 bicentennial proclamation begins with the profoundly inclusive promise that &#x201C;God loves His children in every nation of the world.&#x201D;<a class="note-ref" href="#note3"><sup class="marker">3</sup></a> To each of us in every nation, kindred, tongue, and people,<a class="note-ref" href="#note4"><sup class="marker">4</sup></a> God promises, covenants, and invites us to come partake of His abundant joy and goodness.</p>
<p data-aid="144618921" id="p8">God&#x2019;s love for all people is affirmed throughout scripture.<a class="note-ref" href="#note5"><sup class="marker">5</sup></a> That love encompasses the Abrahamic covenant, gathering His scattered children,<a class="note-ref" href="#note6"><sup class="marker">6</sup></a> and His plan of happiness in our lives.</p>

<p data-aid="144618925" id="p10">This happens when we live and share the gospel. Early in this dispensation, the Prophet Joseph received a remarkable prophecy that Heavenly Father desires everyone everywhere to discover God&#x2019;s love and experience His power to grow and change.</p>

<p data-aid="144618928" id="p11">That prophecy was received here, at the Smith family log home in Palmyra, New York.<a class="note-ref" href="#note10"><sup class="marker">10</sup></a></p>

<p data-aid="144618930" id="p12">Completed in 1998, the Smith home is reconstructed on its original foundation. The second-story bedroom occupies the same 18- by 30- by <span class="page-break" data-page="39"></span>10-foot (5.5 by 9 by 3m) physical space where Moroni, as a glorious messenger from God, came to the young Joseph on the evening of September 21, 1823.<a class="note-ref" href="#note11"><sup class="marker">11</sup></a></p>
<p data-aid="144618933" id="p13">You remember what the Prophet Joseph recounted:</p>
<p data-aid="144618937" id="p14">&#x201C;[Moroni] said &#x2026; God had a work for me to do; and that my name should be had for good and evil among all nations, kindreds, and tongues.&#xA0;&#x2026;</p>
<p data-aid="144618939" id="p15">&#x201C;[Moroni] said there was a book deposited, &#x2026; that the fulness of the everlasting Gospel was contained in it.&#x201D;<a class="note-ref" href="#note12"><sup class="marker">12</sup></a></p>
<p data-aid="144618944" id="p16">Here we pause. We worship God the Eternal Father and His Son, Jesus Christ, not the Prophet Joseph nor any mortal man or woman.</p>
<p data-aid="144618947" id="p17">Yet consider how the prophecies God gives His servants are fulfilled.<a class="note-ref" href="#note13"><sup class="marker">13</sup></a> Some are fulfilled earlier, some later, but all are fulfilled.<a class="note-ref" href="#note14"><sup class="marker">14</sup></a> As we hearken to the Lord&#x2019;s spirit of prophecy, we can become, in our own way, part of the fulfillment of His prophecies and promises&#xFEFF;&#x2014;part of the gospel blessing the world.</p>
<p data-aid="144618950" id="p18">In 1823, Joseph was an unknown 17-year-old boy living in an obscure village in a newly independent country. Unless it were true, how would he imagine to say he would be an instrument in God&#x2019;s work and translate by God&#x2019;s gift and power sacred scripture that would become known everywhere?</p>
<p data-aid="144618952" id="p19">Yet, because it is true, you and I can witness that prophecy being fulfilled even as we are invited to help bring it to pass.</p>
<p data-aid="144618954" id="p20">Brothers and sisters, across the world, each of us participating in this October 2020 general conference is among the nations, kindreds, and tongues spoken of.</p>

<p data-aid="144618974" id="p26">By small and simple means&#xFEFF;&#x2014;in which we are each invited to participate&#xFEFF;&#x2014;great things are brought to pass.</p>
<p data-aid="144618981" id="p27">For example, at a stake conference in Monroe, Utah, population 2,200, I asked how many had served missions. Nearly every hand went up. In recent years, from that one stake, 564 missionaries have served in all 50 U.S. states and 53 countries&#xFEFF;&#x2014;on every continent except Antarctica.</p>
<p data-aid="144618985" id="p28">Speaking of Antarctica, even in Ushuaia, at the southern tip of Argentina, I saw prophecy being fulfilled as our missionaries shared the restored gospel of Jesus Christ in a place called &#x201C;the end of the earth.&#x201D;<a class="note-ref" href="#note20"><sup class="marker">20</sup></a></p>

<p data-aid="144618992" id="p31">Brothers and sisters, as we increase our faith in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, receive the blessings found in living restored gospel truths and sacred covenants, and study, ponder, and share about the ongoing Restoration, we participate in fulfilling prophecy.</p>
<p data-aid="144618994" id="p32">We are changing ourselves and the world in a gospel pattern that blesses lives everywhere.</p>

<p data-aid="144619013" id="p37">A survivor of bitter civil war, a brother in Southeast Asia despaired that life had no meaning. He found hope in a dream in which a former classmate held a sacrament tray and testified of saving ordinances and the Atonement of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p data-aid="144619017" id="p38">Heavenly Father invites us everywhere to feel His love, to learn and grow through education, honorable work, self-reliant service, and patterns of goodness and happiness we find in His restored Church.</p>
<p data-aid="144619022" id="p39">As we come to trust God, sometimes through pleading in our darkest, loneliest, most uncertain moments, we learn He knows us better and loves us more than we know or love ourselves.</p>
<p data-aid="144619026" id="p40">This is why we need God&#x2019;s help to create lasting justice, equality, fairness, and peace in our homes and communities. Our truest, deepest, most authentic narrative, place, and belonging come when we feel God&#x2019;s redeeming love, seek grace and miracles through His Son&#x2019;s Atonement, and establish lasting relationships by sacred covenants.</p>
