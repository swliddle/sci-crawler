And I looked and beheld the Lamb of God, \u2026 [who] was lifted up upon the cross and slain for the sins of the world.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\">4<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152799528\" id=\"p6\">With my \u201clove, share, and invite\u201d zeal now kicking into high gear, I kept reading! To the Nephites in the New World the resurrected Christ said, \u201cMy Father sent me that I might be lifted up upon the cross; \u2026 that I might draw all men unto me, \u2026 and for this cause have I been lifted up.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\">5<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152799533\" id=\"p9\">I was about to quote the Apostle Paul when I noticed that my friend\u2019s eyes were starting to glaze over. A quick look at his wristwatch apparently reminded him that he needed to be somewhere\u2014anywhere\u2014and he dashed off to his fictitious appointment. Thus ended our conversation.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152799538\" id=\"p10\">This morning, some 50 years later, I am determined to finish that explanation\u2014even if every single, solitary one of you start looking at your wristwatches. As I attempt to explain why we generally do <em>not<\/em> use the iconography of the cross, I wish to make abundantly clear our deep respect and profound admiration for the faith-filled motives and devoted lives of those who do.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152799539\" id=\"p11\">One reason we do not emphasize the cross as a symbol stems from our biblical roots. Because crucifixion was one of the Roman Empire\u2019s most agonizing forms of execution, many early followers of Jesus chose not to highlight that brutal instrument of suffering. The meaning of Christ\u2019s death was certainly central to their faith, but for some 300 years they typically sought to convey their gospel identity through other means.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\">6<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152799544\" id=\"p12\">By the fourth and fifth centuries, a cross was being introduced as a symbol of generalized Christianity, but ours is not a \u201cgeneralized Christianity.\u201d Being neither Catholic nor Protestant, we are, rather, a <em>restored<\/em> church, <em>the restored<\/em> New Testament Church. Thus, our origins and our authority go back <em>before<\/em> the time of councils, creeds, and iconography.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\">7<\/sup><\/a> In this sense, the absence of a symbol that was late coming into common use is yet another evidence that The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is a restoration of true Christian beginnings.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152799548\" id=\"p13\">Another reason for not using iconized crosses is our emphasis on the complete miracle of Christ\u2019s mission\u2014His glorious Resurrection as well as His sacrificial suffering and death. In underscoring that relationship, I note two pieces of art<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\">8<\/sup><\/a> that serve as backdrops for the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in their sacred weekly temple meetings each Thursday in Salt Lake City. These portrayals serve as constant reminders to us of the price that was paid and the victory that was won by Him whose servants we are.<\/p>\n<img id=\"img1\" src=\"https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/8c/6e/8c6eb19235b7ba939c2c245480f8a4da545f4f35/8c6eb19235b7ba939c2c245480f8a4da545f4f35.png\" data-img-id=\"dbd9f31c3f5411edafeaeeeeac1e29315a1252ff\" srcset=\"https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/b7/e8/b7e811eecf40acafeb0afb9e66054014f69164cb/b7e811eecf40acafeb0afb9e66054014f69164cb.png 60w,https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/72/eb/72eb69fc274cc6a5e8810669c799df365c526a82/72eb69fc274cc6a5e8810669c799df365c526a82.png 100w,https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/12/32/12320eaeba2cfa59d3d1f8cc929bc2c688452f59/12320eaeba2cfa59d3d1f8cc929bc2c688452f59.png 200w,https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/9a/80/9a80e3be4cf4bcab7e022783d5d15cb6ff9320a4/9a80e3be4cf4bcab7e022783d5d15cb6ff9320a4.png 250w,https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/60/50/6050b08fbc1ee9a57fa884dc9a4a73f524bdbdf7/6050b08fbc1ee9a57fa884dc9a4a73f524bdbdf7.png 320w,https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/8c/6e/8c6eb19235b7ba939c2c245480f8a4da545f4f35/8c6eb19235b7ba939c2c245480f8a4da545f4f35.png 500w,https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/4e/b8/4eb8a81976aaf5d437fd4bd85e5af3372f2e306e/4eb8a81976aaf5d437fd4bd85e5af3372f2e306e.png 640w\" data-assetId=\"dbd9f31c3f5411edafeaeeeeac1e29315a1252ff\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"323\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.5479876160990713\" alt=\"Crucifixion, The\"/>\n<img id=\"img2\" src=\"https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/18/45/18454957ea50a7063040ed532b5dc73a6b654a97/18454957ea50a7063040ed532b5dc73a6b654a97.png\" data-img-id=\"dbf51c413f5411edb126eeeeac1efb3d36a5bb74\" srcset=\"https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/d2/4c/d24cd685872c3b5403b964eb3187ba3be704fd30/d24cd685872c3b5403b964eb3187ba3be704fd30.png 60w,https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/d6/1f/d61f2b18cb835dddcf3f5953ce9094b729df9aff/d61f2b18cb835dddcf3f5953ce9094b729df9aff.png 100w,https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/82/88/82882f807bcd4f0b09fff69b06ab41f6d225b928/82882f807bcd4f0b09fff69b06ab41f6d225b928.png 200w,https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/37/d4/37d425e6d734780e1c835e15b78251a12e3ccd6d/37d425e6d734780e1c835e15b78251a12e3ccd6d.png 250w,https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/c3/e4/c3e4dfa4d76bc2e61b1c1c9b7854c5e47af8a29b/c3e4dfa4d76bc2e61b1c1c9b7854c5e47af8a29b.png 320w,https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/18/45/18454957ea50a7063040ed532b5dc73a6b654a97/18454957ea50a7063040ed532b5dc73a6b654a97.png 500w,https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/9a/4b/9a4bc4016ebc1c8eb282fd6d20cee551b606d247/9a4bc4016ebc1c8eb282fd6d20cee551b606d247.png 640w\" data-assetId=\"dbf51c413f5411edb126eeeeac1efb3d36a5bb74\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"323\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.5479876160990713\" alt=\"Resurrection, The\"/>\n<p data-aid=\"152799550\" id=\"p14\">A more public representation of Christ\u2019s two-part triumph is our use of this small Thorvaldsen image of the resurrected Christ emerging in glory from the tomb with the wounds of His Crucifixion still evident.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\">9<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<img id=\"img3\" src=\"https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/60/2b/602b9d5c45b2470d590ffca1dc5504cbc4858bcc/602b9d5c45b2470d590ffca1dc5504cbc4858bcc.png\" data-img-id=\"dc21f89a3f5411ed82f6eeeeac1eb2755868f5a0\" srcset=\"https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/e6/d3/e6d384eb40e5f7d9283541fec73a05fa3338b895/e6d384eb40e5f7d9283541fec73a05fa3338b895.png 60w,https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/3f/bd/3fbd781d910b4c79adaaefff67923f4041432723/3fbd781d910b4c79adaaefff67923f4041432723.png 100w,https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/71/28/712896fb061d30546c98e0c77b09788a53d8d74d/712896fb061d30546c98e0c77b09788a53d8d74d.png 200w,https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/62/09/620906ac25ca9459a880ca6b1f79dab294a7b468/620906ac25ca9459a880ca6b1f79dab294a7b468.png 250w,https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/b1/df/b1df6697f1dc8a962832f625a85087f44556a3e6/b1df6697f1dc8a962832f625a85087f44556a3e6.png 320w,https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/60/2b/602b9d5c45b2470d590ffca1dc5504cbc4858bcc/602b9d5c45b2470d590ffca1dc5504cbc4858bcc.png 500w,https://assets.churchofjesuschrist.org/20/b3/20b3154f99f015694fe041e28b0d6065d599ff1e/20b3154f99f015694fe041e28b0d6065d599ff1e.png 640w\" data-assetId=\"dc21f89a3f5411ed82f6eeeeac1eb2755868f5a0\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"323\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.5479876160990713\" alt=\"High-Fidelity Symbol\"/>\n<p data-aid=\"152799553\" id=\"p15\">Lastly, we remind ourselves that President Gordon B.

It has nothing to do with pendants or jewelry, with steeples or signposts. It has to do, rather, with the rock-ribbed integrity and stiff moral backbone that Christians should bring to the call Jesus has given to every one of His disciples. In every land and age, He has said to us all, \u201cIf any man [or woman] will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\">11<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152799557\" id=\"p17\">This speaks of the crosses we bear rather than the ones we wear. To be a follower of Jesus Christ, one must sometimes carry a burden\u2014your own or someone else\u2019s\u2014and go where sacrifice is required and suffering is inevitable. A true Christian cannot follow the Master only in those matters with which he or she agrees. <em>No.<\/em> We follow Him everywhere, including, if necessary, into arenas filled with tears and trouble, where sometimes we may stand very much alone.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152799561\" id=\"p18\">I know people, in and out of the Church, who are following Christ just that faithfully. I know children with severe physical disabilities, and I know the parents who care for them. I see all of them working sometimes to the point of total exhaustion, seeking strength, safety, and a few moments of joy that come no other way. I know many single adults who yearn for and deserve a loving companion, a wonderful marriage, and a home full of children of their own. No desire could be more righteous, but year after year such good fortune does not yet come. I know those who are fighting mental illness of many kinds, who plead for help as they pray and pine and claw for the promised land of emotional stability. I know those who live with debilitating poverty but, defying despair, ask only for the chance to make better lives for their loved ones and others in need around them. I know many who wrestle with wrenching matters of identity, gender, and sexuality. I weep for them, and I weep with them, knowing how significant the consequences of their decisions will be.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152799564\" id=\"p19\">These are just a few of so many trying circumstances we may face in life, solemn reminders that there <em>is<\/em> a cost to discipleship. To Araunah, who attempted to give him free oxen and free wood for his burnt offering, King David said, \u201cNay; but I will surely buy it of thee at a price: \u2026 [for I] will [not] offer \u2026 unto the Lord my God \u2026 that which doth cost me nothing.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\">12<\/sup><\/a> So too say we all.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152799569\" id=\"p20\">As we take up our crosses and follow Him, it would be tragic indeed if the weight of our challenges did not make us more empathetic for and more attentive to the burdens being carried by others. It is one of the most powerful paradoxes of the Crucifixion that the arms of the Savior were stretched wide open and then nailed there, unwittingly but accurately portraying that every man, woman, and child in the entire human family is not only welcome but invited into His redeeming, exalting embrace.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\">13<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152799573\" id=\"p21\">As the glorious Resurrection followed the agonizing Crucifixion, so blessings of every kind are poured out on those who are willing, as the Book of Mormon prophet Jacob says, to \u201cbelieve in Christ, and view his death, and suffer his cross.\u201d Sometimes these blessings come soon and sometimes they come later, but the marvelous conclusion to our personal via dolorosa<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note14\"><sup class=\"marker\">14<\/sup><\/a> is the promise from the Master Himself that they do and will come. To obtain such blessings, may we follow Him\u2014unfailingly, never faltering nor fleeing, never flinching at the task, not when our crosses may be heavy and not when, for a time, the path may grow dark. For your strength, your loyalty, and your love, I give deep personal thanks. This day I bear apostolic witness of Him who was \u201clifted up\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note15\"><sup class=\"marker\">15<\/sup><\/a> and of the eternal blessings He bestows to those \u201clifted up\u201d with Him, even the Lord Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<footer class=\"notes\">\n<p class=\"title\" data-aid=\"152799577\" id=\"note_title1\">Notes<\/p>\n<ol class=\"decimal\" data-type=\"marker\" start=\"1\">\n<li data-marker=\"1.\" id=\"note1\" data-full-marker=\"1.\">\n<p data-aid=\"152799581\" id=\"note1_p1\">See Jeffrey R.
