Allow me to share a story about a high school student, Kevin, chosen to travel out of state for a student leader event, as told in his own words.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152799755\" id=\"p2\">\u201cMy turn in line came, and the official-looking registration clerk asked for my name. She looked at her list and said, \u2018So you\u2019re the young man from Utah.\u2019<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152799757\" id=\"p3\">\u201c\u2018You mean I\u2019m the only one?\u2019 I asked.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152799762\" id=\"p4\">\u201c\u2018Yes, the only one.\u2019 She handed me my name tag with \u2018Utah\u2019 printed below my name. As I clipped it on, I felt like I was being branded.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152799767\" id=\"p5\">\u201cI crowded into the hotel elevator with five other high school students with name tags like mine. \u2018Hey, you\u2019re from Utah. Are you a Mormon?\u2019 asked one student.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152799772\" id=\"p6\">\u201cI felt out of place with all these student leaders from all over the country. \u2018Yes,\u2019 I hesitantly admitted.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152799777\" id=\"p7\">\u201c\u2018You\u2019re the guys who believe in Joseph Smith, who said he saw angels. You don\u2019t actually believe that, do you?\u2019<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152799785\" id=\"p8\">\u201cI didn\u2019t know what to say. The students in the elevator were all staring at me. I had just arrived, and already everyone thought I was different. I became a little defensive but then said, \u2018I know that Joseph Smith was a prophet of God.\u2019<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152799789\" id=\"p10\">\u201c\u2018Where had that come from?\u2019 I wondered. I didn\u2019t know I had it in me. But the words felt true.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152799794\" id=\"p11\">\u201c\u2018Yeah, I was told that you were all just religious nuts,\u2019 he said.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152799799\" id=\"p12\">\u201cWith that, there was an uncomfortable pause as the elevator door opened. As we gathered our luggage, he walked down the hall laughing.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152799805\" id=\"p13\">\u201cThen, a voice behind me asked, \u2018Hey, don\u2019t Mormons have some sort of another Bible?\u2019<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152799809\" id=\"p14\">\u201cOh no. Not again. I turned to see another student who had been in the elevator with me, Christopher.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152799813\" id=\"p15\">\u201c\u2018It\u2019s called the Book of Mormon,\u2019 I said, wanting to drop the subject. I picked up my bags and started walking down the hall.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152799818\" id=\"p16\">\u201c\u2018Is that the book Joseph Smith translated?\u2019 he asked.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152799821\" id=\"p17\">\u201c\u2018Yeah, it is,\u2019 I answered.

He later wrote me, telling me he had invited the missionaries to his home.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152799847\" id=\"p23\">\u201cI learned not to be embarrassed to share my testimony.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\">2<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152799852\" id=\"p24\">I am inspired by Kevin\u2019s courage in sharing his testimony. It is a courage repeated every day by faithful members of the Church throughout the world. As I share my thoughts, I invite you to reflect upon these four questions:<\/p>\n<ol class=\"decimal\" start=\"1\">\n<li data-marker=\"1.\">\n<p data-aid=\"152799857\" id=\"p25\">Do I know and understand what a testimony is?<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"2.\">\n<p data-aid=\"152799860\" id=\"p26\">Do I know how to bear my testimony?<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"3.\">\n<p data-aid=\"152799862\" id=\"p27\">What are the obstacles in sharing my testimony?<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"4.\">\n<p data-aid=\"152799865\" id=\"p28\">How do I keep my testimony?<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"152799868\" id=\"title3\">Do I Know and Understand What a Testimony Is?<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"152799871\" id=\"p29\">Your testimony is a most precious possession, often associated with deep spiritual feelings. These feelings are usually communicated quietly and described as a \u201cstill small voice.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\">3<\/sup><\/a> It is your belief or knowledge of truth given as a spiritual witness through the influence of the Holy Ghost. Acquiring this witness will change what you say and how you act. Key elements of your testimony, confirmed by the Holy Ghost, include:<\/p>\n<ul class=\"bullet\">\n<li>\n<p data-aid=\"152799874\" id=\"p30\">God is your Heavenly Father; you are His child. He loves you.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p data-aid=\"152799877\" id=\"p31\">Jesus Christ lives. He is the Son of the living God and your Savior and Redeemer.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p data-aid=\"152799880\" id=\"p32\">Joseph Smith is a prophet of God called to restore the Church of Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p data-aid=\"152799883\" id=\"p33\">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is God\u2019s restored Church on the earth.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p data-aid=\"152799886\" id=\"p34\">The restored Church of Jesus Christ is led by a living prophet today.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"152799889\" id=\"title4\">Do I Know How to Bear My Testimony?<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"152799892\" id=\"p35\">You bear your testimony when you share spiritual feelings with others. As a member of the Church, you have opportunities to bear your spoken testimony in formal Church meetings or in less formal, one-on-one conversations with family, friends, and others.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152799896\" id=\"p36\">Another way you share your testimony is through righteous behavior. Your testimony in Jesus Christ isn\u2019t just what you say\u2014it\u2019s who you are.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152799898\" id=\"p37\">Each time you bear vocal witness or demonstrate through your actions your commitment to follow Jesus Christ, you invite others to \u201ccome unto Christ.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\">4<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152799901\" id=\"p38\">Members of the Church stand as witnesses of God at all times, in all things, and in all places.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\">5<\/sup><\/a> Opportunities to do this in the digital universe using inspiring content of our own or sharing uplifting content prepared by others are endless. We testify when we love, share, and invite, even online. Your tweets, direct messages, and posts will take on a higher, holier purpose when you also use social media to show how the gospel of Jesus Christ shapes your life.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"152799906\" id=\"title5\">What Are the Obstacles in Sharing My Testimony?<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"152799909\" id=\"p39\">Obstacles to sharing your testimony may include uncertainty about what to say. Matthew Cowley, an early Apostle, shared this experience as he departed on a five-year mission at age 17 to New Zealand:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152799913\" id=\"p40\">\u201cI will never forget the prayers of my father the day that I left. I have never heard a more beautiful blessing in all my life. Then his last words to me at the railroad station, \u2018My boy, you will go out on that mission; you will study; you will try to prepare your sermons; and sometimes when you are called upon, you will think you are wonderfully prepared, but when you stand up, your mind will go completely blank.\u2019 I have had that experience more than once.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152799918\" id=\"p41\">\u201cI said, \u2018What do you do when your mind goes blank?\u2019<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152799921\" id=\"p42\">\u201cHe said, \u2018You stand up there and with all the fervor of your soul, you bear witness that Joseph Smith was a prophet of the living God, and thoughts will flood into your mind and words to your mouth \u2026 to the heart of everyone who listens.\u2019 And so my mind, being mostly blank during my \u2026 mission \u2026 , gave me the opportunity to bear testimony to the greatest event in the history of the world since the crucifixion of the Master. Try it sometime, fellows and girls. If you don\u2019t have anything else to say, testify that Joseph Smith was the prophet of God, and the whole history of the Church will flood into your mind.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\">6<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152799923\" id=\"p43\">Likewise, President Dallin H. Oaks shared, \u201cSome testimonies are better gained on the feet bearing them than on the knees praying for them.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\">7<\/sup><\/a> The Spirit bears witness to the speaker and listener alike.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152799926\" id=\"p44\">Another obstacle, as Kevin\u2019s story emphasized, is fear. As Paul wrote to Timothy:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152799930\" id=\"p45\">\u201cGod hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love. \u2026<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152799934\" id=\"p46\">\u201cBe not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\">8<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152799937\" id=\"p47\">Feelings of fear don\u2019t come from the Lord but most often from the adversary. Having faith, as Kevin did, will allow you to overcome these feelings and freely share what is in your heart.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"152799939\" id=\"title6\">How Do I Keep My Testimony?<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"152799942\" id=\"p48\">I believe a testimony is innate within us, yet, in order to keep it and more fully develop it, Alma taught that we must nourish our testimony with much care.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\">9<\/sup><\/a> As we do so, \u201cit will get root, and grow up, and bring forth fruit.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\">10<\/sup><\/a> Without this, \u201cit withers away.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\">11<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152799945\" id=\"p49\">Each beloved member of the First Presidency has provided us with direction on how to keep a testimony.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152799948\" id=\"p64\">President Henry B. Eyring lovingly taught us that \u201cfeasting on the word of God, heartfelt prayer, and obedience to the Lord\u2019s commandments must be applied evenly and continually for your testimony to grow and prosper.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\">12<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152799951\" id=\"p65\">President Dallin H. Oaks reminded us that to retain our testimony, \u201cwe need to partake of the sacrament each week (see <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.9?lang=eng#p9\">D&amp;C 59:9<\/a>) to qualify for the precious promise that we will \u2018always have his Spirit to be with [us]\u2019 (<a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/20.77?lang=eng#p77\">D&amp;C 20:77<\/a>).\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\">13<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152799953\" id=\"p66\">And President Russell M.

Ask the Lord to teach you how to hear Him better. Spend more time in the temple and in family history work.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152799959\" id=\"p52\">\u201c\u2026 Make your testimony your highest priority.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note14\"><sup class=\"marker\">14<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"152799960\" id=\"title7\">Conclusion<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"152799962\" id=\"p53\">My beloved brothers and sisters, I promise that as you more fully understand what a testimony is, and as you share it, you will overcome obstacles of uncertainty and fear, enabling you to nurture and keep this most precious possession, your testimony.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152799965\" id=\"p54\">We are blessed to have countless examples of ancient and modern-day prophets who have boldly borne their testimonies.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152799967\" id=\"p55\">Following Christ\u2019s death, Peter stood and testified:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152799969\" id=\"p56\">\u201cBe it known unto you all \u2026 that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, \u2026 doth this man stand here before you. \u2026<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152799971\" id=\"p57\">\u201c\u2026 For there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note15\"><sup class=\"marker\">15<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152799973\" id=\"p58\">Amulek, following Alma\u2019s sermon on faith, stated powerfully: \u201cI will testify unto you of myself that these things are true. Behold, I say unto you, that I do know that Christ shall come among the children of men, \u2026 and that he shall atone for the sins of the world; for the Lord God hath spoken it.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note16\"><sup class=\"marker\">16<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152799976\" id=\"p59\">Joseph Smith and Sidney Rigdon, upon witnessing a glorious vision of the resurrected Savior, testified:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152799977\" id=\"p60\">\u201cAnd now, after the many testimonies which have been given of him, this is the testimony, last of all, which we give of him: That he lives!<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152799980\" id=\"p61\">\u201cFor we saw him, even on the right hand of God; and we heard the voice bearing record that he is the Only Begotten of the Father.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note17\"><sup class=\"marker\">17<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152799982\" id=\"p62\">Brothers and sisters, I invite you to seek opportunities to bear your testimony in word and in deed. Such an opportunity came to me recently, at the end of a meeting with the mayor of a capital city in South America, in his chambers with a number of his cabinet officials. As we concluded with very cordial feelings, I hesitantly thought I should share my testimony. Following the prompting, I offered a witness that Jesus Christ is the Son of the living God and the Savior of the world. Everything changed at that moment. The Spirit in the room was undeniable. It seemed everyone was touched. \u201cThe Comforter \u2026 beareth record of the Father and of the Son.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note18\"><sup class=\"marker\">18<\/sup><\/a> I am so grateful I summoned the courage to bear my testimony.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152799983\" id=\"p63\">When a moment like this comes, grab it and embrace it. You will feel the warmth of the Comforter inside you when you do.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152799986\" id=\"p67\">I offer my testimony and witness to you\u2014God is our Heavenly Father, Jesus Christ lives, and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is God\u2019s Church on the earth today led by our dear prophet, President Russell M. Nelson.
