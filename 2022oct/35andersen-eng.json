As I see the goodness of your lives and your faith in our Savior here in this country and in the nations across the world, I love you all the more.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798599\" id=\"p4\">Toward the end of His ministry, Jesus\u2019s disciples asked Him to tell them of \u201cthe sign of [His Second Coming], and of the end of the world.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\">1<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798602\" id=\"p5\">Jesus told them of the conditions that would precede His return and concluded by declaring, \u201cWhen ye shall see all these things, [you will] know that [the time] is near.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\">2<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798605\" id=\"p6\">In the last general conference, I listened very closely to the words of President Henry B. Eyring: \u201cEach of us,\u201d he said, \u201cwherever we are, knows that we live in increasingly perilous times. \u2026 Anyone with eyes to see the signs of the times and ears to hear the words of prophets knows that is true.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\">3<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798608\" id=\"p7\">The Savior commended His valiant disciples: \u201cBlessed are <em>your<\/em> eyes, for they see: and <em>your<\/em> ears, for they hear.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\">4<\/sup><\/a> May this blessing be ours as we listen closely to the words of the Lord through His prophets and others in this conference.<\/p>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"152798611\" id=\"p8\">Wheat and Tares<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"152798617\" id=\"p42\">The Lord explained that in this final time prior to His return, the \u201cwheat,\u201d whom He describes as \u201cthe children of the kingdom,\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\">5<\/sup><\/a> would grow side by side with the \u201ctares,\u201d or those who do not love God and do not keep His commandments. They would \u201cboth grow together,\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\">6<\/sup><\/a> side by side.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798621\" id=\"p9\">This will be our world until the Savior returns, with much that is good and much that is evil on every side.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\">7<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798625\" id=\"p10\">You may at times not feel like a strong, mature strand of wheat. Be patient with yourself! The Lord said that the wheat would include tender blades springing up.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\">8<\/sup><\/a> We are all His Latter-day Saints, and although not yet all we want to be, we are serious in our desire to be His true disciples.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"152798629\" id=\"p11\">Strengthen Our Faith in Jesus Christ<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"152798633\" id=\"p43\">We realize that as evil increases in the world, our spiritual survival, and the spiritual survival of those we love, will require that we more fully nurture, fortify, and strengthen the roots of our faith in Jesus Christ. The Apostle Paul counseled us to be rooted,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\">9<\/sup><\/a> grounded, and settled<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\">10<\/sup><\/a> in our love for the Savior and our determination to follow Him. Today and the days ahead require more focused and concentrated effort, guarding against diversions and carelessness.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\">11<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798637\" id=\"p12\">But even with the increasing worldly influences around us, we need not fear. The Lord will never desert His covenant people. There is a compensatory power of spiritual gifts and divine direction for the righteous.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\">12<\/sup><\/a> This added blessing of spiritual power, however, does not settle upon us just because we are part of this generation. It comes as we strengthen our faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and keep His commandments, as we come to know Him and love Him. \u201cThis is life eternal,\u201d Jesus prayed, \u201cthat they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\">13<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798642\" id=\"p14\">As we know very well, having faith in Jesus Christ and being a true disciple is more than a one-time decision\u2014more than a one-time event. It is a sacred, ongoing process that grows and expands through the seasons of our lives, continuing until we kneel at His feet.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798646\" id=\"p15\">With the wheat growing amidst the tares in the world, how can we deepen and strengthen our commitment to the Savior in the days ahead?<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798651\" id=\"p16\">Here are three thoughts:<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"152798656\" id=\"p17\">Immerse Ourselves in the Life of Jesus<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"152798661\" id=\"p44\">First, we can immerse ourselves more completely into Jesus\u2019s life, His teachings, His majesty, His power, and His atoning sacrifice. The Savior said, \u201cLook unto me in every thought.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note14\"><sup class=\"marker\">14<\/sup><\/a> The Apostle John reminds us, \u201cWe love him, because he first loved us.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note15\"><sup class=\"marker\">15<\/sup><\/a> As we better experience His love, we love Him even more and, very naturally, better follow His example of loving and caring for those around us. With every righteous movement toward Him, we see Him more clearly.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note16\"><sup class=\"marker\">16<\/sup><\/a> We adore Him, and we try in our small ways to emulate Him.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note17\"><sup class=\"marker\">17<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"152798670\" id=\"p18\">Make Covenants with the Lord<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"152798678\" id=\"p45\">Next, as we better know and love the Savior, we desire even more to promise Him our allegiance and trust. We make covenants with Him. We begin with our promises at baptism, and we confirm these promises and others as we repent daily, ask for forgiveness, and eagerly anticipate receiving the sacrament each week.

Feeling the influence of eternity in our sacred, quiet moments in the house of the Lord, we gladly make covenants with God and strengthen our resolve to keep them.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798695\" id=\"p20\">Making and keeping covenants allows the love of the Savior to sink more deeply into our heart. In this month\u2019s <cite>Liahona<\/cite>, President Russell M. Nelson said: \u201c[Our] covenant[s] will lead us closer and closer to Him. \u2026 God will not abandon His relationship with those who have forged such a bond with Him.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note19\"><sup class=\"marker\">19<\/sup><\/a> And as President Nelson said so beautifully this morning, \u201cWith the dedication of each new temple, additional godly power comes into the world to strengthen us and counteracts the intensifying efforts of the adversary.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note20\"><sup class=\"marker\">20<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798704\" id=\"p21\">Can we see why the Lord would direct His prophet to bring the holy temples closer to us and allow us to be in His house more often?<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798713\" id=\"p22\">As we enter the temple, we are freed for a time from the worldly influences crowding against us as we learn of our purpose in life and the eternal gifts offered us through our Savior, Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"152798722\" id=\"p23\">Safeguard the Gift of the Holy Ghost<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"152798731\" id=\"p46\">Finally, my third thought: in this sacred quest, we treasure, protect, defend, and safeguard the gift of the Holy Ghost. Both President M. Russell Ballard earlier and Elder Kevin W. Pearson just moments ago spoke of President Nelson\u2019s prophetic warning that I will repeat again: \u201cIt will not be possible to survive spiritually without the guiding, directing, comforting, and constant influence of the Holy Ghost.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note21\"><sup class=\"marker\">21<\/sup><\/a> It is a gift beyond price. We do our very best to protect our daily experiences so the influence of the Holy Ghost remains with us. We are a light to the world, and when necessary, we willingly choose to be different from others. President Dallin H. Oaks recently asked young adults: \u201cDo [you] \u2018dare to be different?\u2019 \u2026 [Especially] important \u2026 are the choices you are making in your personal life. \u2026 Are you going forward against the world\u2019s opposition?\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note22\"><sup class=\"marker\">22<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"152798740\" id=\"p24\">Choose to Be Different from the World<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"152798749\" id=\"p47\">In a recent social media post, I asked fellow disciples to share choices they had made that required them to be different from the world. I received hundreds of responses.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note23\"><sup class=\"marker\">23<\/sup><\/a> Here are just a few:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798758\" id=\"p26\">Amanda: I am a nurse working in the local jail. I try caring for inmates as Christ would.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798767\" id=\"p27\">Rachel: I am an opera singer, and it\u2019s often taken for granted that I will wear whatever costume I\u2019m given, regardless of modesty. [Because I am endowed,] I told [the producers] that the costume would need to be [modest]. They were unhappy \u2026 but reluctantly made the alterations. I wouldn\u2019t trade the peace that comes from standing as a witness of Christ at all times.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798774\" id=\"p28\">Chriss: I\u2019m an alcoholic (in recovery), temple-worthy, member of the Church. I\u2019m not quiet about my experiences with addiction and gaining a testimony of the Atonement [of Jesus Christ].<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798783\" id=\"p29\">Lauren: I was writing a skit with my classmates in high school. They wanted to have my quiet, reserved character have a sudden outburst of profanity. They kept pressuring me, but I refused and held my ground.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798792\" id=\"p30\">Adam: A lot of people do not believe me when I say I keep the law of chastity and choose to abstain from pornography. They don\u2019t understand the advantage of joy and peace of mind it gives me.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798801\" id=\"p32\">Ella: My father is a member of the LGBTQ community. I always try to keep other people\u2019s feelings in consideration while standing as a witness of Christ and being true to what I believe.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798810\" id=\"p40\">Andrade: I decided to continue to go to church when my family decided not to go anymore.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798819\" id=\"p33\">And finally, from Sherry: We were attending an event at the governor\u2019s mansion. They began handing out champagne for a \u201ctoast.\u201d I insisted on water, although the staff said it would be offensive. We toasted the governor, and I held my water glass high! The governor was not offended.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798828\" id=\"p34\">President Nelson said, \u201cYes, you are living in the world, but you have very different standards from the world to help you avoid the stain of the world.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note24\"><sup class=\"marker\">24<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798837\" id=\"p41\">Anastasia, a young mother in Ukraine, was in the hospital having just given birth to a baby boy as the bombings began in Kyiv this past February.

I know He lives and guides His holy work. I do not fully have the words to express my love for Him.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798893\" id=\"p49\">We are all \u201cchildren of the covenant\u201d stretching across the earth in nations and cultures on every continent, numbering in the millions, as we await the glorious return of our Lord and Savior. Shining as a light to those around us, we consciously shape our desires, thoughts, choices, and actions. Seeking with all our heart to know and love the Savior, we separate ourselves from the world through covenants with God, being distinct, uncommon, and special, as we honor Him and His teachings without isolating ourselves from others who believe differently.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798901\" id=\"p50\">It is a wondrous journey to be wheat among the tares, sometimes fraught with heartache but always calmed by the maturing and assuring settling of our faith. As you allow your love for the Savior and His love for you to sink deep into your heart, I promise you added confidence, peace, and joy in meeting the challenges of your life. And the Savior promises us: \u201cI [will] gather together my people, according to the parable of the wheat and the tares, that the wheat may be secured in the garners to possess eternal life, and be crowned with celestial glory.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note26\"><sup class=\"marker\">26<\/sup><\/a> In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<\/div>\n<footer class=\"notes\">\n<p class=\"title\" data-aid=\"152798909\" id=\"note_title1\">Notes<\/p>\n<ol class=\"decimal\" data-type=\"marker\" start=\"1\">\n<li data-marker=\"1.\" id=\"note1\" data-full-marker=\"1.\">\n<p data-aid=\"152798917\" id=\"note1_p1\"><a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/nt/matt/24.3?lang=eng#p3\">Matthew 24:3<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"2.\" id=\"note2\" data-full-marker=\"2.\">\n<p data-aid=\"152798925\" id=\"note2_p1\"><a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/nt/matt/24.33?lang=eng#p33\">Matthew 24:33<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"3.\" id=\"note3\" data-full-marker=\"3.\">\n<p data-aid=\"152798932\" id=\"note3_p1\">Henry B.
