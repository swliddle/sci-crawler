Eddy<\/p>\n<p class=\"author-role\" data-aid=\"152798718\" id=\"author2\">Of the Seventy<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"kicker\" data-aid=\"152798727\" id=\"kicker1\">There is virtue in the words of ancient and modern prophets precisely because their words are the Lord\u2019s words.<\/p>\n<\/header>\n<div class=\"body-block\">\n<p data-aid=\"152798736\" id=\"p1\">In the Book of Mormon, we read of a vital decision made by the prophet Alma in a beloved verse of scripture. Prior to reviewing those familiar words, please consider with me the difficult circumstances under which that decision was made.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798745\" id=\"p2\">A faction of people, calling themselves Zoramites, had separated from the Nephites<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\">1<\/sup><\/a> and gathered in the borders of the land near the Lamanites.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\">2<\/sup><\/a> The Nephites had recently defeated the Lamanites in an unprecedented battle in which tens of thousands were killed,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\">3<\/sup><\/a> and it was \u201cgreatly feared that the Zoramites would enter into a correspondence with the Lamanites, and that it would be the means of great loss.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\">4<\/sup><\/a> Beyond the concerns of war, Alma had learned that the Zoramites, who \u201chad had the word of God preached unto them,\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\">5<\/sup><\/a> were turning to idol worship and \u201cperverting the ways of the Lord.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\">6<\/sup><\/a> All of this weighed heavily on Alma and was \u201cthe cause of great sorrow.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\">7<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798754\" id=\"p3\">Finding himself in these complex and challenging circumstances, Alma pondered what should be done. In his decision we read words that were preserved to inspire and instruct us as we navigate the complex and challenging circumstances of our day.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\">8<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798763\" id=\"p4\">\u201cAnd now, as the preaching of the word had a great tendency to lead the people to do that which was just\u2014yea, it had had more powerful effect upon the minds of the people than the sword, or anything else, which had happened unto them\u2014therefore Alma thought it was expedient that they should <em>try the virtue of the word of God<\/em>.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\">9<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798771\" id=\"p5\">Among many possible solutions, Alma\u2019s faith led them to rely on the power of the word. It is no coincidence that some of the most powerful sermons found anywhere in scripture were preached immediately following that decision. In chapters 32 and 33 of Alma, we read his masterful discourse on faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, and in chapter 34 we find Amulek\u2019s seminal teachings on the Atonement of Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"152798779\" id=\"title2\">Illustrations of the Virtue of the Word<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"152798788\" id=\"p6\">Indeed, throughout scripture we read of miraculous blessings poured out upon those who have chosen to try the virtue of the word of God in their lives.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\">10<\/sup><\/a> I invite you to ponder three examples with me as we turn our focus to the Book of Mormon\u2014a book that President Russell M. Nelson described as \u201cour <em>latter-day<\/em> survival guide.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\">11<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798797\" id=\"p7\">First, reminding his people how the Lord delivered their fathers, Alma taught: \u201cBehold, he changed their hearts; yea, he awakened them out of a deep sleep, and they awoke unto God. Behold, they were in the midst of darkness; nevertheless, <em>their souls were illuminated by the light of the everlasting word<\/em>.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\">12<\/sup><\/a> Perhaps you are feeling as though you were in the midst of darkness. Does your soul ache for illumination? If so, please try the virtue of the word of God.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798806\" id=\"p8\">Second, reflecting on the Lord\u2019s conversion of the Lamanites, which he witnessed as a missionary, Ammon said, \u201cBehold, how many thousands of our brethren has he loosed from the pains of hell; and they are brought to sing redeeming love, and <em>this because of the power of his word which is in us.<\/em>\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\">13<\/sup><\/a> Brothers and sisters, there are so many among us who are yearning for someone we love to be brought to sing redeeming love. In all our efforts, let us remember to try the virtue of the word of God, which is in us.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798815\" id=\"p9\">Third, in the book of Helaman we read, \u201cYea, we see that whosoever <em>will<\/em> may lay hold upon <em>the word of God, which is quick and powerful<\/em>, which shall divide asunder all the cunning and the snares and the wiles of the devil, and lead the man [and woman] of Christ in a strait and narrow course across that everlasting gulf of misery \u2026 and land their souls \u2026 at the right hand of God in the kingdom of heaven.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note14\"><sup class=\"marker\">14<\/sup><\/a> Are you seeking to cut through all the cunning and the snares and the wiles of the devil so prevalent in the philosophies of our day? Do you desire to disperse the clouds of confusion caused by an overabundance of information in order to focus more singularly on the covenant path? Please try the virtue of the word of God.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798824\" id=\"p10\">As one who has been changed by the power of the word, I personally testify of this truth so beautifully taught by our beloved prophet, President Russell M. Nelson: \u201cTo me, the power of the Book of Mormon is most evident in the mighty change that comes into the lives of those who read it \u2018with a sincere heart, with real intent, having faith in Christ.\u2019 Many converts forsake much that they once held dear in order to abide by the precepts of that book. \u2026 It will be your most effective instrument in bringing souls unto Jesus the Christ.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note15\"><sup class=\"marker\">15<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"152798833\" id=\"title3\">The Source of Virtue<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"152798841\" id=\"p11\">In these and other illustrations, we witness the virtue of the word of God in the lives of His children. We might ask, what is the source of that virtue or power?<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798849\" id=\"p12\">As we consider this question, it is essential to remember that the phrase \u201cthe word,\u201d as used in scripture, has at least two meanings. Elder David A. Bednar recently taught that \u201cone of the names of Jesus Christ is \u2018The Word\u2019\u201d and that \u201cthe teachings of the Savior, as recorded in the holy scriptures, also are \u2018the word.\u2019\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note16\"><sup class=\"marker\">16<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798857\" id=\"p13\">The prophet Nephi illustrated the relationship between these two meanings when he wrote: \u201cHearken unto these words and believe in Christ; and if ye believe not in these words believe in Christ. And if ye shall believe in Christ ye <em>will<\/em> believe in these words, for they are the words of Christ, and he hath given them unto me.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note17\"><sup class=\"marker\">17<\/sup><\/a> Thus we learn that there is virtue in the words of ancient and modern prophets <em>precisely<\/em> because their words are the Lord\u2019s words.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note18\"><sup class=\"marker\">18<\/sup><\/a> My dear friends, accepting this eternal truth is critical to our spiritual survival in the latter days<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note19\"><sup class=\"marker\">19<\/sup><\/a> when, as prophesied, there is \u201ca famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but of hearing the words of the Lord.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note20\"><sup class=\"marker\">20<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798866\" id=\"p14\">Ultimately, the virtue of the word of God <em>is<\/em> the Lord Jesus Christ.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note21\"><sup class=\"marker\">21<\/sup><\/a> As we comprehend this more fully, we can make an eternally significant connection between the role of His prophets and the Redeemer Himself. Our love for Him, our desire to draw closer to Him and to abide in His love,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note22\"><sup class=\"marker\">22<\/sup><\/a> will motivate us to try the virtue of the word in our lives\u2014both the virtue that flows from Him as our personal Savior and Redeemer<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note23\"><sup class=\"marker\">23<\/sup><\/a> and the virtue that flows from Him through the words of \u201cthe chosen vessels of the Lord.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note24\"><sup class=\"marker\">24<\/sup><\/a> We will come to discern that, as helpful as other sources may be in our study of the Savior and the words of His prophets, they must never become a replacement for them. We must drink deeply and often<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note25\"><sup class=\"marker\">25<\/sup><\/a> directly from the source.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note26\"><sup class=\"marker\">26<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<\/section>\n<p data-aid=\"152798874\" id=\"p15\">I express my love to each of you, my brothers and my sisters. In that love, I plead with you to experience the virtue of the word of God, particularly through the Book of Mormon, every day of your life. As you do so, you will experience this prophetic promise from President Russell M. Nelson: \u201cI promise that as you prayerfully study the Book of Mormon <em>every day<\/em>, you will make better decisions\u2014<em>every day<\/em>. I promise that as you ponder what you study, the windows of heaven will open, and you will receive answers to your own questions and direction for your own life.
