This doctrine has three parts: (1) the role of belonging in gathering the Lord\u2019s covenant people, (2) the importance of service and sacrifice in belonging, and (3) the centrality of Jesus Christ to belonging.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798538\" id=\"p4\">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in its early beginnings was made up largely of white North American and northern European Saints with a relative handful of Native Americans, African Americans, and Pacific Islanders. Now, eight years away from the 200th anniversary of its founding, the Church has greatly increased in numbers and diversity in North America and even more so in the rest of the world.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798541\" id=\"p5\">As the long-prophesied latter-day gathering of the Lord\u2019s covenant people gains momentum, the Church will truly be composed of members from every nation, kindred, tongue, and people.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\">1<\/sup><\/a> This is not a calculated or forced diversity but a naturally occurring phenomenon that we would expect, recognizing that the gospel net gathers from every nation and every people.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798545\" id=\"p6\">How blessed we are to see the day that Zion is being established simultaneously on every continent and in our own neighborhoods. As the Prophet Joseph Smith said, the people of God in every age have looked forward with joyful anticipation to this day, and \u201cwe are the favored people that God has made choice of to bring about the Latter-day glory.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\">2<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798548\" id=\"p7\">Having been given this privilege, we cannot permit any racism, tribal prejudice, or other divisions to exist in the latter-day Church of Christ. The Lord commands us, \u201cBe one; and if ye are not one ye are not mine.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\">3<\/sup><\/a> We should be diligent in rooting prejudice and discrimination out of the Church, out of our homes, and, most of all, out of our hearts. As our Church population grows ever more diverse, our welcome must grow ever more spontaneous and warm. We need one another.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\">4<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798550\" id=\"p8\">In his First Epistle to the Corinthians, Paul declares that all who are baptized into the Church are one in the body of Christ:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798554\" id=\"p9\">\u201cFor as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798558\" id=\"p10\">\u201cFor by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit. \u2026<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798562\" id=\"p11\">\u201cThat there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798566\" id=\"p12\">\u201cAnd whether one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or one member be honoured, all the members rejoice with it.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\">5<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798570\" id=\"p13\">A sense of belonging is important to our physical, mental, and spiritual well-being. Yet it is quite possible that at times each of us might feel that we don\u2019t fit in. In discouraging moments, we may feel that we will never measure up to the Lord\u2019s high standards or the expectations of others.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\">6<\/sup><\/a> We may unwittingly impose expectations on others\u2014or even ourselves\u2014that are not the Lord\u2019s expectations. We may communicate in subtle ways that the worth of a soul is based on certain achievements or callings, but these are not the measure of our standing in the Lord\u2019s eyes. \u201cThe Lord looketh on the heart.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\">7<\/sup><\/a> He cares about our desires and longings and what we are becoming.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\">8<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798575\" id=\"p14\">Sister Jodi King wrote of her own experience of past years:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798580\" id=\"p15\">\u201cI never felt like I didn\u2019t belong at church until my husband, Cameron, and I began struggling with infertility. The children and families who had typically brought me joy to see at church now started causing me grief and pain.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798584\" id=\"p16\">\u201cI felt barren without a child in my arms or a diaper bag in hand. \u2026<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798588\" id=\"p17\">\u201cThe hardest Sunday was our first one in a new ward. Because we didn\u2019t have kids, we were asked if we were newlyweds and when we planned on starting a family. I had gotten pretty good at answering these questions without letting them affect me\u2014I knew they weren\u2019t meant to be hurtful.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798591\" id=\"p18\">\u201cHowever, on this particular Sunday, answering those questions was especially hard. We had just found out, after being hopeful, that we were\u2014yet again\u2014not pregnant.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798594\" id=\"p19\">\u201cI walked into sacrament meeting feeling downtrodden, and answering those typical \u2018get to know you\u2019 questions was hard for me. \u2026<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798597\" id=\"p20\">\u201cBut it was Sunday School that truly broke my heart. The lesson\u2014intended to be about the divine role of mothers\u2014quickly shifted gears and became a vent[ing] session. My heart sank and tears silently flowed down my cheeks as I heard women complain about a blessing I would give anything for.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798600\" id=\"p21\">\u201cI bolted out of church. At first, I didn\u2019t want to go back. I didn\u2019t want to experience that feeling of isolation again. But that night, after talking with my husband, we knew we would keep attending church not only because the Lord has asked us to but also because we both knew that the joy that comes from renewing covenants and feeling the Spirit at church surpasses the sadness I felt that day. \u2026<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798603\" id=\"p23\">\u201cIn the Church, there are widowed, divorced, and single members; those with family members who have fallen away from the gospel; people with chronic illnesses or financial struggles; members who experience same-sex attraction; members working to overcome addictions or doubts; recent converts; new move-ins; empty-nesters; and the list goes on and on. \u2026<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798606\" id=\"p25\">\u201cThe Savior invites us to come unto Him\u2014no matter our circumstances. We come to church to renew our covenants, to increase our faith, to find peace, and to do as He did perfectly in His life\u2014minister to others who feel like they don\u2019t belong.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\">9<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798609\" id=\"p26\">Paul explained that the Church and its officers are given by God \u201cfor the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798612\" id=\"p27\">\u201cTill we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\">10<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798615\" id=\"p28\">It is a sad irony, then, when someone, feeling he or she doesn\u2019t meet the ideal in all aspects of life, concludes that he doesn\u2019t or she doesn\u2019t belong in the very organization designed by God to help us progress toward the ideal.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798619\" id=\"p29\">Let us leave judgment in the Lord\u2019s hands and those He has commissioned and be content to love and treat each other the best we can. Let us ask Him to show us the way, day by day, to \u201cbring in \u2026 the poor, and the maimed, and the halt, and the blind\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\">11<\/sup><\/a>\u2014that is, everyone\u2014to the great feast of the Lord.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798623\" id=\"p30\">A second facet of the doctrine of belonging has to do with our own contributions. Although we rarely think about it, much of our belonging comes from our service and the sacrifices we make for others and for the Lord. Excessive focus on our personal needs or our own comfort can frustrate that sense of belonging.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798626\" id=\"p49\">We strive to follow the Savior\u2019s doctrine:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798630\" id=\"p42\">\u201cWhosoever will be great among you, shall be your <em>minister<\/em>. \u2026<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798634\" id=\"p43\">\u201cFor even the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\">12<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798638\" id=\"p44\">Belonging comes not as we wait for it but as we reach out to help one another.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798643\" id=\"p31\">Today, unfortunately, consecrating oneself to a cause or sacrificing anything for anyone else is becoming countercultural. In a piece for <cite>Deseret Magazine<\/cite> last year, author Rod Dreher recounted a conversation with a young mother in Budapest:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798648\" id=\"p32\">\u201cI am on a Budapest tram with a \u2026 friend in her early 30s\u2014let\u2019s call her Kristina\u2014while we are on the way to interview an older [Christian] woman who, with her late husband, withstood persecution by the communist state. As we bump along the city\u2019s streets, Kristina talks about how hard it is to be honest with friends her age about the struggles she faces as a wife and mother of young children.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798653\" id=\"p33\">\u201cKristina\u2019s difficulties are completely ordinary for a young woman learning how to be a mom and a wife\u2014yet the prevailing attitude among her generation is that life\u2019s difficulties are a threat to one\u2019s well-being and should be refused. Do she and her husband argue at times? Then she should leave him, they say. Are her children annoying her? Then she should send them to day care.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798657\" id=\"p34\">\u201cKristina worries that her friends don\u2019t grasp that trials, and even suffering, are a normal part of life\u2014and maybe even part of a good life, if that suffering teaches us how to be patient, kind and loving. \u2026<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798662\" id=\"p35\">\u201c\u2026 University of Notre Dame sociologist of religion Christian Smith found in his study of adults [ages] 18 to 23 that most of them believe society is nothing more than \u2018a collection of autonomous individuals out to enjoy life.\u2019\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\">13<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798668\" id=\"p45\">By this philosophy, anything that one finds difficult \u201cis a form of oppression.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note14\"><sup class=\"marker\">14<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798674\" id=\"p36\">By contrast, our pioneer forebears derived a deep sense of belonging, unity, and hope in Christ by the sacrifices they made to serve missions, build temples, abandon comfortable homes under duress and begin again, and in a multitude of other ways consecrate themselves and their means to the cause of Zion. They were willing to sacrifice even their lives if necessary. And we are all the beneficiaries of their endurance. The same is true for many today who may lose family and friends, forfeit employment opportunities, or otherwise suffer discrimination or intolerance as a consequence of being baptized. Their reward, however, is a powerful sense of belonging among the covenant people. Any sacrifice we make in the Lord\u2019s cause helps to confirm our place with Him who gave His life a ransom for many.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798682\" id=\"p37\">The final and most important element of the doctrine of belonging is the central role of Jesus Christ. We don\u2019t join the Church for fellowship alone, important as that is. We join for redemption through the love and grace of Jesus Christ. We join to secure the ordinances of salvation and exaltation for ourselves and those we love on both sides of the veil. We join to participate in a great project to establish Zion in preparation for the Lord\u2019s return.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798691\" id=\"p38\">The Church is the custodian of the covenants of salvation and exaltation that God offers us through the ordinances of the holy priesthood.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note15\"><sup class=\"marker\">15<\/sup><\/a> It is by keeping these covenants that we obtain the highest and deepest sense of belonging. President Russell M. Nelson recently wrote:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798699\" id=\"p46\">\u201cOnce you and I have made a covenant with God, our relationship with Him becomes much closer than before our covenant. Now we are bound together. Because of our covenant with God, He will never tire in His efforts to help us, and we will never exhaust His merciful patience with us. Each of us has a special place in God\u2019s heart. \u2026<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798708\" id=\"p47\">\u201c\u2026 Jesus Christ is the guarantor of those covenants (see <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/nt/heb/7.22?lang=eng#p22\">Hebrews 7:22<\/a>; <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/nt/heb/8.6?lang=eng#p6\">8:6<\/a>).\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note16\"><sup class=\"marker\">16<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798717\" id=\"p48\">If we will remember this, the Lord\u2019s high hopes for us will inspire, not discourage, us.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798726\" id=\"p39\">We can feel joy as we pursue, individually and communally, \u201cthe measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note17\"><sup class=\"marker\">17<\/sup><\/a> Despite disappointments and setbacks along the way, it is a grand quest. We lift and encourage each other in pursuing the upward path, knowing that no matter tribulation and no matter delays in promised blessings, we can \u201cbe of good cheer; [for Christ has] overcome the world,\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note18\"><sup class=\"marker\">18<\/sup><\/a> and we are with Him. Being one with the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit is without doubt the ultimate in belonging.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note19\"><sup class=\"marker\">19<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798735\" id=\"p40\">Thus, the doctrine of belonging comes down to this\u2014each one of us can affirm: Jesus Christ died for me; He thought me worthy of His blood. He loves me and can make all the difference in my life. As I repent, His grace will transform me. I am one with Him in the gospel covenant; I belong in His Church and kingdom; and I belong in His cause to bring redemption to all of God\u2019s children.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798744\" id=\"p41\">I testify you do belong, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<footer class=\"notes\">\n<p class=\"title\" data-aid=\"152798753\" id=\"note_title1\">Notes<\/p>\n<ol class=\"decimal\" data-type=\"marker\" start=\"1\">\n<li data-marker=\"1.\" id=\"note1\" data-full-marker=\"1.\">\n<p data-aid=\"152798762\" id=\"note1_p1\">See <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/nt/rev/5.9?lang=eng#p9\">Revelation 5:9<\/a>; see also <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/19.17?lang=eng#p17\">1 Nephi 19:17<\/a>; <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/15.28?lang=eng#p28\">Mosiah 15:28<\/a>; <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/10.51?lang=eng#p51\">Doctrine and Covenants 10:51<\/a>; <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/77.8,11?lang=eng#p8\">77:8, 11<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"2.\" id=\"note2\" data-full-marker=\"2.\">\n<p data-aid=\"152798772\" id=\"note2_p1\"><cite><a class=\"cross-ref\" href=\"/study/manual/teachings-joseph-smith/chapter-15?lang=eng&amp;para=8#p8\">Teachings of Presidents of the Church: Joseph Smith<\/a><\/cite> (2007), 186.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"3.\" id=\"note3\" data-full-marker=\"3.\">\n<p data-aid=\"152798781\" id=\"note3_p1\"><a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/38.27?lang=eng#p27\">Doctrine and Covenants 38:27<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"4.\" id=\"note4\" data-full-marker=\"4.\">\n<p data-aid=\"152798790\" id=\"note4_p1\">One perceptive observer noted:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798799\" id=\"note4_p2\">\u201cReligion that is merely a private affair has been, until our time, unknown in the annals of mankind\u2014and for good reason.
