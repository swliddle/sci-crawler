As the sacrament prayer indicated our willingness to \u201ctake upon [ourselves] the name of [Jesus Christ],\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\">1<\/sup><\/a> the Holy Ghost reminded me that Jesus has many names. This question then came to my heart: \u201cWhich of Jesus\u2019s names should I take upon myself this week?\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798730\" id=\"p2\">Three names came to my mind, and I wrote them down. Each of those three names contained Christlike attributes that I wanted to develop more fully. In the week that followed, I focused on those three names and tried to embrace their corresponding attributes and characteristics. Since that time, I\u2019ve continued to ask that question as part of my personal worship: \u201cWhich of Jesus\u2019s names should I take upon myself this week?\u201d Answering that question and striving to develop the related Christlike attributes has blessed my life.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798739\" id=\"p3\">In His great Intercessory Prayer, Jesus expressed this important truth: \u201cAnd this is life eternal, that <em>they might know thee<\/em> the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\">2<\/sup><\/a> Today I\u2019d like to share with you the blessings and power that come from knowing Jesus Christ by His many names.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798748\" id=\"p4\">One simple way we get to know someone is by learning their name. It has been said that \u201ca person\u2019s name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\">3<\/sup><\/a> Have you ever had the experience of calling someone by the wrong name or forgetting their name? My wife, Alexis, and I have, on occasion, called one of our children \u201cLola.\u201d Unfortunately, as you may have guessed, Lola is our dog! For better or worse, forgetting someone\u2019s name communicates to that person that you probably don\u2019t know them very well.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798756\" id=\"p5\">Jesus knew and called people by name. To ancient Israel, the Lord said, \u201cFear not: for I have redeemed thee, <em>I have called thee by thy name<\/em>; thou art mine.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\">4<\/sup><\/a> On Easter morning, Mary\u2019s witness of the resurrected Christ was solidified when Jesus called her by name.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\">5<\/sup><\/a> Likewise, God called Joseph Smith by name in answer to his prayer of faith.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\">6<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798765\" id=\"p6\">In some cases, Jesus gave His disciples new names that were indicative of their nature, capacity, and potential. Jehovah gave Jacob the new name of Israel, which means \u201cone who prevails with God\u201d or \u201clet God prevail.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\">7<\/sup><\/a> Jesus gave James and John the name of Boanerges, which meant the \u201csons of thunder.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\">8<\/sup><\/a> Seeing his future leadership, Jesus gave Simon the name of Cephas or Peter, which means a rock.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\">9<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798768\" id=\"p7\">Just as Jesus knows each of us by name, one way we can come to better know Jesus is by learning His many names. Like the names of Israel and Peter, many of Jesus\u2019s names are titles that help us understand His mission, purpose, character, and attributes. As we come to know Jesus\u2019s many names, we will come to better understand His divine mission and His selfless character. Knowing His many names also inspires us to become more like Him\u2014to develop Christlike attributes that bring joy and purpose to our lives.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798777\" id=\"p8\">A few years ago, President Russell M. Nelson studied all the scriptures concerning Jesus Christ in the Topical Guide.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\">10<\/sup><\/a> He then invited young adults to study these same scriptures. Concerning Jesus\u2019s many names, President Nelson said, \u201cStudy everything Jesus Christ <em>is<\/em> by prayerfully and vigorously seeking to understand what each of His various titles and names means <em>personally<\/em> for you.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\">11<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798786\" id=\"p9\">Following President Nelson\u2019s invitation, I began developing my own list of Jesus\u2019s many names. My personal list now has over 300 names, and I\u2019m sure there are many more that I haven\u2019t discovered yet.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798795\" id=\"p10\">While there are some of Jesus\u2019s names that are reserved only for Him,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\">12<\/sup><\/a> I would like to share five names and titles that have application to each of us. I invite you to develop your own list as you come to know Jesus by His many names. In doing so, you will find that there are other names\u2014along with their corresponding Christlike attributes\u2014that you will want to take upon yourself as Jesus\u2019s covenant disciple.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\">13<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798805\" id=\"p11\">First, Jesus is the <strong>Good Shepherd<\/strong>.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note14\"><sup class=\"marker\">14<\/sup><\/a> As such, Jesus knows His sheep,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note15\"><sup class=\"marker\">15<\/sup><\/a> \u201ccalleth his own sheep by name,\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note16\"><sup class=\"marker\">16<\/sup><\/a> and, as the Lamb of God, gave His life for His sheep.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note17\"><sup class=\"marker\">17<\/sup><\/a> Similarly, Jesus wants us to be good shepherds, particularly in our families and as ministering brothers and sisters. One way we demonstrate our love for Jesus is by feeding His sheep.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note18\"><sup class=\"marker\">18<\/sup><\/a> For those sheep who may be wandering, good shepherds go into the wilderness to find the lost sheep and then stay with them until they return to safety.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note19\"><sup class=\"marker\">19<\/sup><\/a> As good shepherds and as local conditions permit, we should seek to spend more time ministering to people in their homes. In our ministering, texting and technology should be used to enhance, not replace, personal contact.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note20\"><sup class=\"marker\">20<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798814\" id=\"p12\">Second, Jesus is the <strong>High Priest of Good Things to Come<\/strong>.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note21\"><sup class=\"marker\">21<\/sup><\/a> Knowing that His Crucifixion was just hours away, Jesus said: \u201cThese things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace.
