Bednar<\/p>\n<p class=\"author-role\" data-aid=\"152798693\" id=\"author2\">Of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"kicker\" data-aid=\"152798702\" id=\"kicker1\">Each of us should evaluate our temporal and spiritual priorities sincerely and prayerfully.<\/p>\n<\/header>\n<div class=\"body-block\">\n<p data-aid=\"152798711\" id=\"p1\">Parables are a defining feature of the Lord Jesus Christ\u2019s masterful approach to teaching. Simply defined, the Savior\u2019s parables are stories used to compare spiritual truths with material things and mortal experiences. For example, the New Testament Gospels are replete with teachings likening the kingdom of heaven to a grain of mustard seed,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\">1<\/sup><\/a> to a pearl of great price,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\">2<\/sup><\/a> to a householder and laborers in his vineyard,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\">3<\/sup><\/a> to ten virgins,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\">4<\/sup><\/a> and to many other things. During part of the Lord\u2019s Galilean ministry, the scriptures indicate that \u201cwithout a parable spake he not unto them.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\">5<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798720\" id=\"p2\">The intended meaning or message of a parable typically is not expressed explicitly. Rather, the story only conveys divine truth to a receiver in proportion to his or her faith in God, personal spiritual preparation, and willingness to learn. Thus, an individual must exercise moral agency and actively \u201cask, seek, and knock\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\">6<\/sup><\/a> to discover the truths embedded in a parable.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798729\" id=\"p3\">I earnestly pray that the Holy Ghost will enlighten each of us as we now consider the importance of the parable of the royal marriage feast.<\/p>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"152798738\" id=\"title2\">The Royal Marriage Feast<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"152798747\" id=\"p4\">\u201cAnd Jesus \u2026 spake unto them again by parables, and said,<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798757\" id=\"p5\">\u201cThe kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made a marriage for his son,<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798766\" id=\"p6\">\u201cAnd sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding: and they would not come.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798776\" id=\"p7\">\u201cAgain, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come unto the marriage.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798785\" id=\"p8\">\u201cBut they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his farm, another to his merchandise.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\">7<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798794\" id=\"p9\">In ancient times, one of the most joyous occasions in Jewish life was a wedding celebration\u2014an event that would span a week or even two. Such an event required extensive planning, and guests were informed far in advance, with a reminder sent on the opening day of the festivities. An invitation from a king to his subjects to a wedding such as this was essentially considered a command. Yet, many of the bidden guests in this parable did not come.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\">8<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798803\" id=\"p10\">\u201cThe refusal to attend the king\u2019s feast was a deliberate [act of] rebellion against \u2026 royal authority and a personal indignity against both the reigning sovereign and his son. \u2026 The turning away by one man to his farm and by another to his [business interests]\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\">9<\/sup><\/a> reflects their misguided priorities and total disregard of the king\u2019s will.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\">10<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798812\" id=\"p11\">The parable continues:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798821\" id=\"p12\">\u201cThen saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they which were bidden were not worthy.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798831\" id=\"p13\">\u201cGo ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall find, bid to the marriage.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798838\" id=\"p14\">\u201cSo those servants went out into the highways, and gathered together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the wedding was furnished with guests.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\">11<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798846\" id=\"p15\">The custom in those days was for the host of a wedding feast\u2014in this parable, the king\u2014to provide garments for the wedding guests. Such wedding garments were simple, nondescript robes that all attendees wore. In this way, rank and station were eliminated, and everyone at the feast could mingle as equals.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\">12<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798854\" id=\"p16\">People invited from the highways to attend the wedding would not have had the time or means to procure appropriate attire in preparation for the event. Consequently, the king likely gave guests the garments from his own wardrobe. Everyone was given the opportunity to clothe themselves in garments of royalty.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\">13<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798862\" id=\"p17\">As the king entered the wedding hall, he surveyed the audience and immediately noticed that one conspicuous guest was not wearing a wedding garment. The man was brought forward, and the king asked, \u201cFriend, how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment? And he was speechless.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note14\"><sup class=\"marker\">14<\/sup><\/a> In essence, the king asked, \u201cWhy are you not wearing a wedding garment, even though one was provided for you?\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note15\"><sup class=\"marker\">15<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798870\" id=\"p18\">The man obviously was not dressed properly for this special occasion, and the phrase \u201cAnd he was speechless\u201d indicates that the man was without excuse.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note16\"><sup class=\"marker\">16<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798878\" id=\"p19\">Elder James E. Talmage provides this instructive commentary about the significance of the man\u2019s actions: \u201cThat the unrobed guest was guilty of neglect, intentional disrespect, or some more grievous offense, is plain from the context. The king at first was graciously considerate, inquiring only as to how the man had entered without a wedding garment. Had the guest been able to explain his exceptional appearance, or had he any reasonable excuse to offer, he surely would have spoken; but we are told that he remained speechless. The king\u2019s summons had been freely extended to all whom his servants had found; but each of them had to enter the royal palace by the door; and before reaching the banquet room, in which the king would appear in person, each would be properly attired; but the deficient one, by some means had entered by another way; and not having passed the attendant sentinels at the portal, he was an intruder.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note17\"><sup class=\"marker\">17<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798886\" id=\"p21\">A Christian author, John O. Reid, noted that the man\u2019s refusal to wear the wedding garment exemplified blatant \u201cdisrespect for both the king and his son.\u201d He did not simply lack a wedding garment; rather, he chose not to wear one. He rebelliously refused to dress appropriately for the occasion. The king\u2019s reaction was swift and decisive: \u201cBind him hand and foot, and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note18\"><sup class=\"marker\">18<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798895\" id=\"p22\">The king\u2019s judgment of the man is not based primarily upon the lack of a wedding garment\u2014but that \u201che was, in fact, determined not to wear one. The man \u2026 desired the honor of attending the wedding feast, but \u2026 did not want to follow the custom of the king. He wanted to do things his own way. His lack of proper dress revealed his inner rebellion against the king and his instructions.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note19\"><sup class=\"marker\">19<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"152798903\" id=\"title3\">Many Are Called, but Few Are Chosen<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"152798911\" id=\"p23\">The parable then concludes with this penetrating scripture: \u201cFor many are called, but few are chosen.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note20\"><sup class=\"marker\">20<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798919\" id=\"p24\">Interestingly, Joseph Smith made the following adjustment to this verse from Matthew in his inspired translation of the Bible: \u201cFor many are called, but few are chosen; <i>wherefore all do not have on the wedding garment<\/i>.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note21\"><sup class=\"marker\">21<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798927\" id=\"p25\">The <em>invitation to<\/em> the wedding feast and the <em>choice to partake in<\/em> the feast are related but different. The invitation is to all men and women. An individual may even accept the invitation and sit down at the feast\u2014yet not be chosen to partake because he or she does not have the appropriate wedding garment of converting faith in the Lord Jesus and His divine grace. Thus, we have both God\u2019s call and our individual response to that call, and many may be called but few chosen.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note22\"><sup class=\"marker\">22<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798935\" id=\"p26\">To be or to become chosen is not an exclusive status conferred upon us. Rather, you and I ultimately can choose to be chosen through the righteous exercise of our moral agency.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798942\" id=\"p27\">Please note the use of the word <i>chosen<\/i> in the following familiar verses from the Doctrine and Covenants:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798949\" id=\"p36\">\u201cBehold, there are many called, but few are <em>chosen<\/em>. And why are they not <em>chosen<\/em>?<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798955\" id=\"p37\">\u201cBecause their hearts are set so much upon the things of this world, and aspire to the honors of men.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note23\"><sup class=\"marker\">23<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798962\" id=\"p28\">I believe the implication of these verses is quite straightforward. God does not have a list of favorites to which we must hope our names will someday be added. He does not limit \u201cthe chosen\u201d to a restricted few. Instead, <em>our<\/em> hearts, <em>our<\/em> desires, <em>our<\/em> honoring of sacred gospel covenants and ordinances, <em>our<\/em> obedience to the commandments, and, most importantly, the Savior\u2019s redeeming grace and mercy determine whether we are counted as one of God\u2019s chosen.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note24\"><sup class=\"marker\">24<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798969\" id=\"p29\">\u201cFor we labor diligently to write, to persuade our children, and also our brethren, to believe in Christ, and to be reconciled to God; for we know that it is by grace that we are saved, after all we can do.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note25\"><sup class=\"marker\">25<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798976\" id=\"p30\">In the busyness of our daily lives and in the commotion of the contemporary world in which we live, we may be distracted from the eternal things that matter the most by making pleasure, prosperity, popularity, and prominence our primary priorities. Our short-term preoccupation with \u201cthe things of this world\u201d and \u201cthe honors of men\u201d may lead us to forfeit our spiritual birthright for far less than a mess of pottage.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note26\"><sup class=\"marker\">26<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"152798983\" id=\"title4\">Promise and Testimony<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"152798990\" id=\"p31\">I repeat the admonition of the Lord to His people delivered through the Old Testament prophet Haggai: \u201cNow therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts; Consider your ways.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note27\"><sup class=\"marker\">27<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798997\" id=\"p32\">Each of us should evaluate our temporal and spiritual priorities sincerely and prayerfully to identify the things in our lives that may impede the bounteous blessings that Heavenly Father and the Savior are willing to bestow upon us.
