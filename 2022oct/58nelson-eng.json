I pray that you have recorded your impressions and will follow through with them. Our Heavenly Father and His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ, stand ready to help you. I urge you to increase your efforts to seek Their help.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152799928\" id=\"p2\">Recently, Sister Nelson and I had the opportunity to preview the new season 4 of the <em><a href=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/videos-and-images/book-of-mormon-videos\">Book of Mormon Videos<\/a><\/em> series.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\">1<\/sup><\/a> We were inspired by them! May I show you a brief excerpt from the scene depicting the Savior\u2019s appearance to the Nephites.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152799932\" id=\"p3\">It is significant that the Savior chose to appear to the people at the temple. It is His house. It is filled with His power. Let us never lose sight of what the Lord is doing for us now. He is making His temples more accessible. He is accelerating the pace at which we are building temples. He is increasing our ability to help gather Israel. He is also making it easier for each of us to become spiritually refined. I promise that increased time in the temple will bless your life in ways nothing else can.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152799936\" id=\"p5\">We currently have 168 operating temples and 53 new temples under construction and another 54 in the preconstruction design phase!<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\">2<\/sup><\/a> I am pleased to announce our plans to build a new temple in each of the following locations: Busan, Korea; Naga, Philippines; Santiago, Philippines; Eket, Nigeria; Chiclayo, Peru; Buenos Aires City Center, Argentina; Londrina, Brazil; Ribeirão Prêto, Brazil; Huehuetenango, Guatemala; Jacksonville, Florida; Grand Rapids, Michigan; Prosper, Texas; Lone Mountain, Nevada; and Tacoma, Washington.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152799938\" id=\"p6\">We are also planning to build multiple temples in selected large metropolitan areas where travel time to an existing temple is a major challenge. Therefore, I am pleased to announce four additional locations near Mexico City where new temples will be built in Cuernavaca, Pachuca, Toluca, and Tula.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152799941\" id=\"p7\">My dear brothers and sisters, may you focus on the temple in ways you never have before. I bless you to grow closer to God and Jesus Christ every day. I love you. May God be with you until we meet again, I pray in the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<footer class=\"notes\">\n<p class=\"title\" data-aid=\"152799944\" id=\"note_title1\">Notes<\/p>\n<ol class=\"decimal\" data-type=\"marker\" start=\"1\">\n<li data-marker=\"1.\" id=\"note1\" data-full-marker=\"1.\">\n<p data-aid=\"152799947\" id=\"note1_p1\">These new videos will be available in many languages on Gospel Library and other channels.
