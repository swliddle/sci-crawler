Jack was so proud of Cassie and often bragged about what a skilled dog she was. To prove this, Jack invited some friends to watch Cassie perform. After arriving at the hunting club, Jack let Cassie out to run around while he went inside to check in.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798639\" id=\"p2\">When it was time to begin, Jack was anxious to show off Cassie\u2019s amazing skills. However, Cassie was acting strangely. She wouldn\u2019t obey any of Jack\u2019s commands as she usually did so willingly. All she wanted to do was remain by his side.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798644\" id=\"p3\">Jack was frustrated and embarrassed and angry with Cassie; soon he suggested they leave. Cassie wouldn\u2019t even jump into the back of the truck, so Jack impatiently picked her up and shoved her in the kennel. He fumed as those with him made fun of his dog\u2019s behavior all the way home. Jack couldn\u2019t understand why Cassie was misbehaving. She had been trained well, and her whole desire in the past had been to please and serve him.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798649\" id=\"p4\">After arriving home, Jack began examining Cassie for injuries, burrs, or ticks, as he usually did. As he put his hand on her chest, he felt something wet and found his hand covered with blood. To his shame and horror, he found that Cassie had a long, wide gash right to her chest bone. He found another on her right front leg, also to the bone.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798654\" id=\"p5\">Jack took Cassie into his arms and began to cry. His shame at how he had misjudged and treated her was overwhelming. Cassie had been acting uncharacteristically earlier in the day because she was hurt. Her behavior had been influenced by her pain, her suffering, and her wounds. It had nothing to do with a lack of desire to obey Jack or a lack of love for him.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\">1<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798659\" id=\"p6\">I heard this story years ago and have never forgotten it. How many wounded individuals do we have among us? How often do we judge others based on their outward appearance and actions, or <em>lack<\/em> of action, when, if we fully understood, we would instead react with compassion and a desire to help instead of adding to their burdens with our judgment?<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798664\" id=\"p7\">I have been guilty of this many times in my life, but the Lord has patiently taught me through personal experiences and as I have listened to the life experiences of many others. I have come to more fully appreciate the example of our dear Savior as He spent so much of <em>His<\/em> time ministering to others with love.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798672\" id=\"p8\">My youngest daughter\u2019s life experience has included emotional health challenges from the time she was a little girl. There have been many times throughout her life when she felt like she couldn\u2019t go on. We will be forever grateful to the earthly angels who have been there during those times: sitting with her, listening to her, crying with her, as well as sharing <em>together<\/em> unique gifts, spiritual understandings, and a mutual relationship of love. In such <em>loving<\/em> circumstances, burdens have often been lifted on <em>both<\/em> sides.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798680\" id=\"p9\">Elder Joseph B. Wirthlin, quoting 1 Corinthians, said, \u201cThough I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\">2<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798688\" id=\"p10\">He continued:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798697\" id=\"p28\">\u201cPaul\u2019s message to this new body of Saints was simple and direct: Nothing you do makes much of a difference if you do not have charity. You can speak with tongues, have the gift of prophecy, understand all mysteries, and possess all knowledge; even if you have the faith to move mountains, without charity it won\u2019t profit you at all.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798706\" id=\"p27\">\u201c\u2018Charity is the pure love of Christ\u2019 [<a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/7.47?lang=eng#p47\">Moroni 7:47<\/a>]. The Savior exemplified that love.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\">3<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798715\" id=\"p11\">In John we read, \u201cBy <em>this<\/em> shall all men know that ye are my disciples, <em>if ye have love one to another<\/em>.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\">4<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798724\" id=\"p12\">Many talks have been given by our Church leaders on charity, unity, love, kindness, compassion, forgiveness, and mercy. I believe the Savior is inviting us to live a higher, holier way<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\">5<\/sup><\/a>\u2014<em>His<\/em> way of love where <em>all<\/em> can feel they truly belong and are needed.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798733\" id=\"p13\">We are commanded to <em>love<\/em> others,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\">6<\/sup><\/a> not to judge them.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\">7<\/sup><\/a> Let\u2019s lay down that heavy burden; it isn\u2019t ours to carry.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\">8<\/sup><\/a> Instead, we can pick up the Savior\u2019s yoke of love and compassion.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798742\" id=\"p14\">\u201cCome unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798751\" id=\"p15\">\u201cTake my yoke upon you, and learn of me; \u2026<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798760\" id=\"p16\">\u201cFor <em>my<\/em> yoke is easy, and <em>my<\/em> burden is light.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\">9<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798775\" id=\"p17\">The Savior does not condone sin but offers us His love and extends forgiveness when we repent. To the woman caught in adultery, He said, \u201cNeither do <em>I<\/em> condemn thee: go, and sin no more.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\">10<\/sup><\/a> Those He touched felt His <em>love<\/em>, and that love healed and transformed them. <em>His<\/em> love inspired them to <em>want<\/em> to change their lives. Living <em>His<\/em> way brings joy and peace, and He invited others to that way of living with gentleness, kindness, and love.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798784\" id=\"p18\">Elder Gary E. Stevenson said: \u201cWhen we confront life\u2019s wind and rainstorms, sickness and injuries, the Lord\u2014our Shepherd, our Caregiver\u2014will nourish us with love and kindness. He will heal our hearts and restore our souls.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\">11<\/sup><\/a> As followers of Jesus Christ, shouldn\u2019t we do likewise?<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798793\" id=\"p19\">The Savior asks us to learn of Him<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\">12<\/sup><\/a> and do the things we have seen Him do.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\">13<\/sup><\/a> He is the embodiment of charity, of pure love. As we incrementally learn to do what He asks of us\u2014not out of duty or even for the blessings we might receive but purely out of love for Him and our Heavenly Father<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note14\"><sup class=\"marker\">14<\/sup><\/a>\u2014His love will flow through us and make all that He asks not only possible but eventually much easier and lighter<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note15\"><sup class=\"marker\">15<\/sup><\/a> and more joyful than we could ever imagine. It will take practice; it could take years, as it has for me, but as we even desire to have love be our motivating force, He can take that desire,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note16\"><sup class=\"marker\">16<\/sup><\/a> that seed, and eventually turn it into a beautiful tree, full of the sweetest fruit.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note17\"><sup class=\"marker\">17<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798802\" id=\"p20\">We sing in one of our beloved hymns: \u201cWho am I to judge another when I walk imperfectly? In the quiet heart is hidden sorrow that the eye can\u2019t see.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note18\"><sup class=\"marker\">18<\/sup><\/a> Who among <em>us<\/em> might have hidden sorrows? The seemingly rebellious child or teenager, the children of divorce, the single mother or father, those with physical or mental health challenges, those questioning their faith, those who experience racial or cultural prejudice, those feeling alone, those longing to be married, those with unwanted addictions, and so many others dealing with a wide variety of challenging life experiences\u2014often even those whose lives appear perfect on the surface.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798811\" id=\"p21\">None of us have perfect lives or perfect families; I certainly don\u2019t. When we seek to empathize with others who <em>also<\/em> experience challenges and imperfections, it can help them feel that they are not alone in <em>their<\/em> struggles. <em>Everyone<\/em> needs to feel that they really <em>do<\/em> belong and <em>are<\/em> needed in the body of Christ.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note19\"><sup class=\"marker\">19<\/sup><\/a> Satan\u2019s great desire is to divide God\u2019s children, and he has been very successful, but there is such power in unity.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note20\"><sup class=\"marker\">20<\/sup><\/a> And how we need to walk arm in arm with each other on this challenging journey of mortality!<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798820\" id=\"p22\">Our prophet, President Russell M.
