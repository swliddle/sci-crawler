He will lead you the right way. He is your strength.<\/p>\n<\/header>\n<div class=\"body-block\">\n<p data-aid=\"152797986\" id=\"p1\">In preparing for this message today, I have felt strong promptings to address the young women and young men.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152797988\" id=\"p2\">I am also speaking to those who used to be young, even to those who can\u2019t really remember it anymore.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152797989\" id=\"p3\">And I speak to all who love our young people and want them to succeed in life.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152797992\" id=\"p4\">For the rising generation, I have a message especially for you from our Savior, Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"152797994\" id=\"title2\">The Savior\u2019s Message to You<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"152797996\" id=\"p5\">My dear young friends, if the Savior were here right now, what would He say to you?<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152797998\" id=\"p6\">I believe He would start by expressing His deep love for you. He might say it with words, but it would also flow so strongly\u2014just from His presence\u2014that it would be unmistakable, reaching deep into your heart, filling your whole soul!<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798000\" id=\"p7\">And yet, because we\u2019re all weak and imperfect, some concerns might creep into your mind. You might remember mistakes you\u2019ve made, times you gave in to temptation, things you wish you hadn\u2019t done\u2014or wish you had done better.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798001\" id=\"p8\">The Savior would sense that, and I believe He would assure you with words He has spoken in the scriptures:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798003\" id=\"p50\">\u201cFear not.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\">1<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798005\" id=\"p51\">\u201cDoubt not.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\">2<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798007\" id=\"p52\">\u201cBe of good cheer.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\">3<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798008\" id=\"p53\">\u201cLet not your heart be troubled.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\">4<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798010\" id=\"p9\">I don\u2019t think He would make excuses for your mistakes. He wouldn\u2019t minimize them. No, He would ask you to repent\u2014to leave your sins behind, to change, so He can forgive you. He would remind you that 2,000 years ago He took those sins upon Himself so that you <em>could<\/em> repent. That is part of the plan of happiness gifted to us from our loving Heavenly Father.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798013\" id=\"p10\">Jesus might point out that your covenants with Him\u2014made when you were baptized and renewed each time you partake of the sacrament\u2014give you a special connection with Him. The kind of connection the scriptures describe as being yoked together so that, with His help, you can carry any burden.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\">5<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798014\" id=\"p11\">I believe the Savior Jesus Christ would want you to see, feel, and know that He is your strength. That with His help, there are no limits to what you can accomplish. That your potential is limitless. He would want you to see yourself the way He sees you. And that is very different from the way the world sees you.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798016\" id=\"p12\">The Savior would declare, in no uncertain terms, that you are a daughter or son of the Almighty God. Your Heavenly Father is the most glorious being in the universe, full of love, joy, purity, holiness, light, grace, and truth. And one day He wants you to inherit all He has.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\">6<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798018\" id=\"p13\">It is the reason why you\u2019re on the earth\u2014to learn, grow, and progress and become everything your Father in Heaven has created you for.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798020\" id=\"p14\">To make this possible, He sent Jesus Christ to be your Savior. It\u2019s the purpose behind His great plan of happiness, His Church, His priesthood, the scriptures\u2014all of it.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798023\" id=\"p15\"><em>That<\/em> is your destiny. <em>That<\/em> is your future. <em>That is your choice!<\/em><\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"152798026\" id=\"title3\">Truth and Choices<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"152798028\" id=\"p16\">At the heart of God\u2019s plan for your happiness is your power to choose.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\">7<\/sup><\/a> Of course, your Heavenly Father wants you to choose eternal joy with Him, and He will help you to achieve it, but He would never force it upon you.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798030\" id=\"p17\">So He allows you to choose: Light or darkness? Good or evil? Joy or misery?

But you can manage when you know who you are, why you are here, and when you trust God.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798042\" id=\"p21\">So where do you find truth?<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798045\" id=\"p22\">It is contained in the gospel of Jesus Christ. And the fulness of that gospel is taught in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798049\" id=\"p23\">Jesus Christ said, \u201cI am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\">11<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"152798051\" id=\"p24\">When you have important choices to make, Jesus Christ and His restored gospel are the best choice.

In a way, this is what the Pharisees of Jesus\u2019s day tried to do. In their zeal to stop people from breaking the law, they compiled hundreds of rules based on their understanding of sacred writings. What the Pharisees got wrong was that they thought their rules would save them.

Principles are eternal and universal. Specific rules or applications of those principles work well in some places but not in others. What unites us is Jesus Christ and the eternal truths He taught, even if specific applications vary over time and across cultures. So the problem with listing every possible do and don\u2019t isn\u2019t just that it\u2019s impractical and unsustainable.

It wasn\u2019t until later that I learned from the scriptures that my conduct and my attitude on the Sabbath constituted a <em>sign<\/em> between me and my Heavenly Father.

When I had to make a decision whether or not an activity was appropriate for the Sabbath, I simply asked myself, \u2018What <em>sign<\/em> do I want to give to God?\u2019 That question made my choices about the Sabbath day crystal clear\u201d (\u201c<a class=\"cross-ref\" href=\"/study/general-conference/2015/04/the-sabbath-is-a-delight?lang=eng&amp;para=11#p11\">The Sabbath Is a Delight<\/a>,\u201d <cite>Ensign<\/cite> or <cite>Liahona<\/cite>, May 2015, 130).<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"23.\" id=\"note23\" data-full-marker=\"23.\">\n<p data-aid=\"152799195\" id=\"note23_p1\">Elder DavidÂ A.
