Let me mention, in particular, those who are currently single.<\/p>\n<\/header>\n<div class=\"body-block\">\n<p data-aid=\"146039597\" id=\"p1\">Brothers and sisters, at this Easter time we focus on the glorious Resurrection of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. We remember His loving invitation to \u201ccome unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039605\" id=\"p41\">\u201cTake my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039613\" id=\"p42\">\u201cFor my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\">1<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039621\" id=\"p2\">The Savior\u2019s invitation to come unto Him is an invitation to all not only to come unto Him but also to belong to His Church.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039626\" id=\"p3\">In the verse preceding this loving invitation, Jesus teaches how this is done by seeking to follow Him. He declared, \u201cNo man [or woman] knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man [or woman] the Father, save the Son, and he [or she] to whomsoever the Son will reveal him.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\">2<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039634\" id=\"p4\">Jesus wants us to know God is a loving Heavenly Father.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039646\" id=\"p5\">Knowing that we are loved by our Heavenly Father will help us know who we are and know that we belong to His great eternal family.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039655\" id=\"p6\">The Mayo Clinic recently noted: \u201cHaving a sense of belonging is so important. \u2026 Nearly every aspect of our lives is organized around belonging to something.\u201d This report adds, \u201cWe cannot separate the importance of a sense of belonging from our physical and mental health\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\">3<\/sup><\/a>\u2014and, I would add, our spiritual health.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039664\" id=\"p7\">On the evening before His suffering in Gethsemane and death on the cross, the Savior met with His disciples for the Last Supper. He said to them, \u201cIn the world <em>ye shall have tribulation<\/em>: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\">4<\/sup><\/a> Before sunset the following day, Jesus Christ had suffered and had \u201cdied [on the cross] for our sins.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\">5<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039673\" id=\"p8\">I wonder how lonely the faithful women and men who followed Him must have felt in Jerusalem as the sun set and darkness and fear encompassed them.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\">6<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039682\" id=\"p9\">Like these ancient disciples nearly 2,000 years ago, many of you may also feel lonely from time to time. I have experienced this loneliness since the death of my precious wife, Barbara, over two and a half years ago. I know what it is to be surrounded by family members, friends, and associates but still feel lonely\u2014because the love of my life is no longer here beside me.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039689\" id=\"p10\">The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted this sense of isolation and loneliness for many. Nevertheless, despite the challenges we face in life, we can, like on that first Easter morning, awake to a new life in Christ, with new and marvelous possibilities and new realities as we turn to the Lord for hope and belonging.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039696\" id=\"p12\">I personally feel the pain of those who lack a sense of belonging. As I watch news from around the world, I see many who seem to be experiencing this loneliness. I think that, for many, it is because they may not know that they are loved by Heavenly Father and that we all belong to His eternal family. Believing that God loves us and that we are His children is comforting and assuring.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039703\" id=\"p14\">Because we are the spirit children of God, everyone has a divine origin, nature, and potential. Each of us \u201cis a beloved spirit son or daughter of heavenly parents.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\">7<\/sup><\/a> This is our identity! This is who we really are!<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039710\" id=\"p15\">Our spiritual identity is enhanced as we understand our many mortal identities, including ethnic, cultural, or national heritage.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039717\" id=\"p17\">This sense of spiritual and cultural identity, love, and belonging can inspire hope and love for Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039725\" id=\"p18\">I speak of hope in Christ not as wishful thinking. Instead, I speak of hope as an expectation that will be realized. Such hope is essential to overcoming adversity, fostering spiritual resilience and strength, and coming to know that we are loved by our Eternal Father and that we are His children, who belong to His family.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039733\" id=\"p19\">When we have hope in Christ, we come to know that as we need to make and keep sacred covenants, our fondest desires and dreams can be fulfilled through Him.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039740\" id=\"p20\">The Quorum of the Twelve Apostles have counseled together in a spirit of prayer and with a yearning to understand how to help all who feel alone or feel they don\u2019t belong. We long to help all who feel this way. Let me mention, in particular, those who are currently single.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039748\" id=\"p21\">Brothers and sisters, more than half of adults in the Church today are widowed, divorced, or not yet married. Some wonder about their opportunities and place in God\u2019s plan and in the Church. We should understand that eternal life is not simply a question of current marital status but of discipleship and being \u201cvaliant in the testimony of Jesus.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\">8<\/sup><\/a> The hope of all who are single is the same as for all members of the Lord\u2019s restored Church\u2014access to the grace of Christ through \u201cobedience to the laws and ordinances of the Gospel.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\">9<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039754\" id=\"p22\">May I suggest that there are some important principles we need to understand.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039761\" id=\"p23\"><em>First, scriptures and latter-day prophets confirm that everyone who is faithful in keeping gospel covenants will have the opportunity for exaltation<\/em>. President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson taught: \u201cIn the Lord\u2019s own way and time, no blessing will be withheld from His faithful Saints. The Lord will judge and reward each individual according to heartfelt desire as well as deed.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\">10<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039768\" id=\"p24\"><em>Second, the precise time and manner in which the blessings of exaltation are bestowed have not all been revealed, but they are nonetheless assured<\/em>.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\">11<\/sup><\/a> President Dallin&nbsp;H. Oaks explained that some of the circumstances \u201cof mortality will be set right in the Millennium, which is the time for fulfilling all that is incomplete in the great plan of happiness for all of our Father\u2019s worthy children.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\">12<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039775\" id=\"p25\">That doesn\u2019t mean that every blessing is deferred until the Millennium; some have already been received, and others will continue to be received until that day.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\">13<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039786\" id=\"p26\"><em>Third, waiting upon the Lord implies continued obedience and spiritual progress toward Him<\/em>. Waiting upon the Lord does not imply biding one\u2019s time. You should never feel like you are in a <em>waiting<\/em> room. <\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039794\" id=\"p43\">Waiting upon the Lord implies action. I have learned over the years that our hope in Christ increases when we serve others. Serving as Jesus served, we naturally increase our hope in Him.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039800\" id=\"p44\">The personal growth one can achieve now while waiting upon the Lord and His promises is an invaluable, sacred element of His plan for each one of us. The contributions one can make now to help build up the Church on earth and to gather Israel are much needed. Marital status has nothing to do with one\u2019s capacity to serve.

All those who accept the Savior\u2019s gracious gift of repentance and live His commandments will receive eternal life, even though they do not attain to all its characteristics and perfections in mortality.
