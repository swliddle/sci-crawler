Now His tomb was empty, and she did not know where He was. It was too much for her to take in, and she wept. At that moment, the resurrected Savior came to her and asked why she was weeping and whom she was seeking. Thinking that the gardener spoke to her, she asked that, if he had taken her Lord&#2019;s body, to tell her where it was so she could get it.<sup class="noteMarker"><a href="#note12">12</a><span class="footnote">[See <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/john/20.11-15?lang=eng#p11">John 20:11&#2013;15</a>.]</span></sup></p>

<p data-aid="146039824" id="p12">Like you, in some way I can relate to the anguish felt by Mary Magdalene and her friends as they grieved the death of their Lord. When I was nine years old, I lost my older brother during a devastating earthquake. Because it happened unexpectedly, it took me a while to grasp the reality of what had occurred. I was heartbroken by sorrow, and I would ask myself, &#201C;What happened to my brother? Where is he? Where did he go? Will I ever see him again?&#201D;</p>
<p data-aid="146039832" id="p13">Back then I did not yet know about God&#2019;s plan of salvation, and I had the desire to know where we come from, what the purpose of life is, and what happens to us after we die. Don&#2019;t we all have those yearnings when we lose a loved one or when we go through difficulties in our lives?</p>
<p data-aid="146039840" id="p14">A few years after, I started thinking of my brother in a specific way. I would imagine him knocking on our door. I would open the door, he would be standing there, and he would tell me, &#201C;I am not dead. I am alive. I could not come to you, but now I will stay with you and never leave again.&#201D; That imagining, almost a dream, helped me cope with the pain that I felt over losing him. The thought that he would be with me came to my mind over and over. Sometimes I would even stare at the door, hoping that he would knock and I would see him again.</p>
<p data-aid="146039847" id="p15">About 40 years later, during Easter time, I was pondering about the Resurrection of Jesus Christ and started thinking about my brother. At that moment, something clicked in my mind. I remembered imagining him coming to see me. </p>
<p data-aid="146039853" id="p16">That day I realized that the Spirit had given me comfort in a difficult time. I had received a witness that my brother&#2019;s spirit is not dead; he is alive. He is still progressing in his eternal existence. I now know that &#201C;[my] brother shall rise again&#201D;<sup class="noteMarker"><a href="#note15">15</a><span class="footnote">[<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/john/11.23?lang=eng#p23">John 11:23</a>.]</span></sup> at that magnificent moment when, because of Jesus Christ&#2019;s Resurrection, we will all be resurrected. In addition, He has made it possible for all of us to be reunited as families and have eternal joy in the presence of God if we will choose to make and keep sacred covenants with Him.</p>
<p data-aid="146039860" id="p17">President Nelson has taught:</p>
<p data-aid="146039868" id="p18">&#201C;Death is a necessary component of our eternal existence. No one knows when it will come, but it is essential to God&#2019;s great plan of happiness. Thanks to the Atonement of the Lord, eventual resurrection is a reality and eternal life is a possibility for all humankind.&nbsp;&#2026;</p>
<p data-aid="146039878" id="p19">&#201C;&#2026; For sorrowing loved ones left behind&nbsp;&#2026; the sting of death is soothed by a steadfast faith in Christ, a perfect brightness of hope, a love of God and of all men, and a deep desire to serve them.
