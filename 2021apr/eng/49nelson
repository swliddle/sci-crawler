He is risen!&#201D; For example, the exchange of Easter greetings by Russian speakers begins with &#201C;Христос воскрес&#201D; (Christ is risen [resurrected]!), answered by &#201C;Воистину! воскрес!&#201D; (Truly! He is risen!).]</span></sup> The atoning sacrifice and Resurrection of Jesus Christ changed each of our lives forever. We love Him and gratefully worship Him and our Heavenly Father.</p>
<p data-aid="146039940" id="p3">During the past six months, we have continued to grapple with a global pandemic. I marvel at your resilience and spiritual strength in the face of illness, loss, and isolation. I pray constantly that, through it all, you will feel the Lord&#2019;s unfailing love for you. If you have responded to your trials with a stronger discipleship, this past year will not have been in vain.</p>
<p data-aid="146039951" id="p4">This morning, we have heard from Church leaders who come from every populated continent on earth. Truly, the blessings of the gospel are for <em>every</em> race, language, and people. The Church of Jesus Christ is a <em>global</em> church. Jesus Christ is our leader.</p>
<p data-aid="146039962" id="p5">Thankfully, even a pandemic has not been able to slow the onward march of His truth. The gospel of Jesus Christ is exactly what is needed in this confused, contentious, and weary world.</p>
<p data-aid="146039974" id="p6">Each of God&#2019;s children deserves the opportunity to hear and accept the healing, redeeming message of Jesus Christ. No other message is more vital to our happiness&#2014;now and forever.<sup class="noteMarker"><a href="#note2">2</a><span class="footnote">[See <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/2.41?lang=eng#p41">Mosiah 2:41</a>.]</span></sup> No other message is more filled with hope. No other message can eliminate contention in our society.</p>
<p data-aid="146039987" id="p9">Faith in Jesus Christ is the foundation of all belief and the conduit of divine power. According to the Apostle Paul, &#201C;Without faith it is impossible to please [God]: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.&#201D;<sup class="noteMarker"><a href="#note3">3</a><span class="footnote">[<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/heb/11.6?lang=eng#p6">Hebrews 11:6</a>. <cite>Lectures on Faith</cite> states that faith &#201C;is the first great governing principle which has power, dominion, and authority over all things&#201D; ([1985], 5).]</span></sup></p>
<p data-aid="146039991" id="p10">Everything good in life&#2014;every potential blessing of eternal significance&#2014;begins with faith. Allowing God to prevail in our lives begins with faith that He is willing to guide us. True repentance begins with faith that Jesus Christ has the power to cleanse, heal, and strengthen us.<sup class="noteMarker"><a href="#note4">4</a><span class="footnote">[See <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/matt/11.28-30?lang=eng#p28">Matthew 11:28&#2013;30</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/7.12-13?lang=eng#p12">Alma 7:12&#2013;13</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/12.27?lang=eng#p27">Ether 12:27</a>.]</span></sup></p>

<p data-aid="146040015" id="p12">And yet, exercising faith can seem overwhelming. At times we may wonder if we can possibly muster enough faith to receive the blessings that we so desperately need. However, the Lord put those fears to rest through the words of the Book of Mormon prophet Alma.</p>

<p data-aid="146040028" id="p13">Alma asks us simply to <em>experiment</em> upon the word and &#201C;exercise a <em>particle</em> of faith, yea, even if [we] can no more than desire to believe.&#201D;<sup class="noteMarker"><a href="#note6">6</a><span class="footnote">[<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.27?lang=eng#p27">Alma 32:27</a>; emphasis added.]</span></sup> The phrase &#201C;particle of faith&#201D; reminds me of the Lord&#2019;s biblical promise that if we &#201C;have faith as a <em>grain of mustard seed</em>,&#201D; we shall be able to &#201C;say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and <em>nothing shall be impossible unto [us]</em>.&#201D;<sup class="noteMarker"><a href="#note7">7</a><span class="footnote">[<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/matt/17.20?lang=eng#p20">Matthew 17:20</a>, emphasis added; see also <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/hel/12.9,13?lang=eng#p9">Helaman 12:9,&nbsp;13</a>.]</span></sup></p>

<p data-aid="146040038" id="p14">The Lord understands our mortal weakness. We all falter at times. But He also knows of our great potential.

<p data-aid="146040042" id="p15">The Lord does not require <em>perfect</em> faith for us to have access to His <em>perfect</em> power. But He does ask us to believe.</p>
<p data-aid="146040051" id="p16">My dear brothers and sisters, my call to you this Easter morning is to <em>start today</em> to increase your faith. Through your faith, Jesus Christ will increase your ability to move the mountains in your life,<sup class="noteMarker"><a href="#note9">9</a><span class="footnote">[See <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/7.12?lang=eng#p12">1&nbsp;Nephi 7:12</a>.]</span></sup> even though your personal challenges may loom as large as Mount Everest.</p>
<p data-aid="146040065" id="p17">Your mountains may be loneliness, doubt, illness, or other personal problems. Your mountains will vary, and yet the answer to each of your challenges is to increase your faith. That takes work. Lazy learners and lax disciples will always struggle to muster even a particle of faith.</p>
<p data-aid="146040071" id="p18">To do anything well requires effort. Becoming a true disciple of Jesus Christ is no exception. Increasing your faith and trust in Him takes effort. May I offer five suggestions to help you develop that faith and trust.</p>
<p data-aid="146040087" id="p19">First, <strong>study</strong>. Become an engaged learner. Immerse yourself in the scriptures to understand better Christ&#2019;s mission and ministry. Know the doctrine of Christ so that you understand its power for your life. Internalize the truth that the Atonement of Jesus Christ applies to <em>you</em>. He took upon Himself <em>your</em> misery, <em>your</em> mistakes, <em>your</em> weakness, and <em>your</em> sins. He paid the compensatory price and provided the power for you to move <em>every</em> mountain you will ever face. You obtain that power with your faith, trust, and willingness to follow Him.</p>
<p data-aid="146040094" id="p20">Moving your mountains may require a miracle. Learn about miracles. Miracles come according to your faith in the Lord. Central to that faith is trusting His will and timetable&#2014;how and when He will bless you with the miraculous help you desire. Only <em>your</em> <em>un</em>belief will keep God from blessing you with miracles to move the mountains in <em>your</em> life.<sup class="noteMarker"><a href="#note10">10</a><span class="footnote">[See <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/morm/9.19-21?lang=eng#p19">Mormon 9:19&#2013;21</a>; <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/ether/12.30?lang=eng#p30">Ether 12:30</a>.]</span></sup></p>
<p data-aid="146040103" id="p21">The more you learn about the Savior, the easier it will be to trust in His mercy, His infinite love, and His strengthening, healing, and redeeming power. The Savior is never closer to you than when you are facing or climbing a mountain <em>with faith</em>.</p>
<p data-aid="146040115" id="p22">Second, choose to <strong>believe</strong> in Jesus Christ. If you have doubts about God the Father and His Beloved Son or the validity of the Restoration or the veracity of Joseph Smith&#2019;s divine calling as a prophet, <em>choose</em> to believe<sup class="noteMarker"><a href="#note11">11</a><span class="footnote">[See <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/33.10-11?lang=eng#p10">2&nbsp;Nephi 33:10&#2013;11</a>.]</span></sup> and stay faithful. Take your questions to the Lord and to other faithful sources. Study with the desire to <em>believe</em> rather than with the hope that you can find a flaw in the fabric of a prophet&#2019;s life or a discrepancy in the scriptures. Stop increasing your doubts by rehearsing them with other doubters. Allow the Lord to lead you on your journey of spiritual discovery.</p>
<p data-aid="146040119" id="p24">Third, <strong>act</strong> in faith. What would you do if you had <em>more</em> faith? Think about it. Write about it. Then <em>receive more</em> faith by doing something that <em>requires more</em> faith.</p>
<p data-aid="146040125" id="p25">Fourth, <strong>partake of sacred ordinances</strong> worthily. Ordinances unlock the power of God for your life.<sup class="noteMarker"><a href="#note12">12</a><span class="footnote">[See <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.20?lang=eng#p20">Doctrine and Covenants 84:20</a>.]</span></sup></p>
<p data-aid="146040133" id="p26">And fifth, <strong>ask</strong> your Heavenly Father, in the name of Jesus Christ, for help.</p>
<p data-aid="146040138" id="p27">Faith takes work. Receiving revelation takes work. But &#201C;every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.&#201D;<sup class="noteMarker"><a href="#note13">13</a><span class="footnote">[<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/matt/7.8?lang=eng#p8">Matthew 7:8</a>.]</span></sup> God knows what will help your faith grow. Ask, and then ask again.</p>
<p data-aid="146040140" id="p28">A nonbeliever might say that faith is for the weak. But this assertion overlooks the <em>power</em> of faith. Would the Savior&#2019;s Apostles have continued to teach His doctrine after His death, at the peril of their lives, if they had doubted Him?<sup class="noteMarker"><a href="#note14">14</a><span class="footnote">[Without the power of faith, would Abinadi have suffered death by fire for refusing to deny what he knew to be true?

Bashore, H.&nbsp;Dennis Tolley, and the BYU Pioneer Mortality Team, &#201C;Mortality on the Mormon Trail, 1847&#2013;1868,&#201D; <cite>BYU Studies</cite>, vol. 53, no. 4 (2014), 115.]</span></sup> if they did not have faith that the gospel of Jesus Christ had been restored? Truly, faith is the power that <em>enables</em> the unlikely to accomplish the impossible.</p>
<p data-aid="146040144" id="p29">Do not minimize the faith you already have. It takes faith to join the Church and remain faithful. It takes faith to follow prophets rather than pundits and popular opinion. It takes faith to serve a mission during a pandemic. It takes faith to live a chaste life when the world shouts that God&#2019;s law of chastity is now outmoded. It takes faith to teach the gospel to children in a secular world. It takes faith to plead for the life of a loved one and even more faith to accept a disappointing answer.</p>
<p data-aid="146040145" id="p30">Two years ago, Sister Nelson and I visited Samoa, Tonga, Fiji, and Tahiti. Each of those island nations had experienced heavy rains for days. Members had fasted and prayed that their outdoor meetings would be protected from the rain.</p>
<p data-aid="146040150" id="p31">In Samoa, Fiji, and Tahiti, <em>just</em> as the meetings began, the rain stopped. But in Tonga, the rain did <em>not</em> stop. Yet 13,000 faithful Saints came hours early to get a seat, waited patiently through a steady downpour, and then sat through a very wet two-hour meeting.</p>

<p data-aid="146040153" id="p32">We saw vibrant faith at work among each of those islanders&#2014;faith sufficient to stop the rain and faith to persevere when the rain did not stop.</p>
<p data-aid="146040160" id="p33">The mountains in our lives do not always move how or when we would like. But our faith will <em>always</em> propel us forward. Faith <em>always</em> increases our access to godly power.</p>
