<h2 data-aid="146039650" id="p36">The Sacred Responsibility of Safeguarding Life</h2>
</header>
<p data-aid="146039659" id="p12">Years ago, feeling deep concern for the number of abortions in the world, President Gordon&nbsp;B. Hinckley addressed the women of the Church with words that are relevant for us today. He said: &#201C;You who are wives and mothers are the anchors of the family. You bear the children. What an enormous and sacred responsibility that is. &#2026; What is happening to our appreciation of the sanctity of human life? Abortion is an evil, stark and real and repugnant, which is sweeping over the earth. I plead with the women of this Church to shun it, to stand above it, to stay away from those compromising situations which make it appear desirable. There may be some few circumstances under which it can occur, but they are extremely limited.<sup class="noteMarker"><a href="#note10">10</a><span class="footnote">[The official position of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints:</p>
<p data-aid="146039950" id="note10_p8">&#201C;The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints believes in the sanctity of human life. Therefore, the Church opposes elective abortion for personal or social convenience, and counsels its members not to submit to, perform, encourage, pay for, or arrange for such abortions.</p>
<p data-aid="146039961" id="note10_p2">&#201C;The Church allows for possible exceptions for its members when:</p>
<p data-aid="146039972" id="note10_p3">&#201C;Pregnancy results from rape or incest, or</p>
<p data-aid="146039989" id="note10_p4">&#201C;A competent physician determines that the life or health of the mother is in serious jeopardy, or</p>
<p data-aid="146039996" id="note10_p5">&#201C;A competent physician determines that the fetus has severe defects that will not allow the baby to survive beyond birth.</p>
<p data-aid="146040006" id="note10_p6">&#201C;The Church teaches its members that even these rare exceptions do not justify abortion automatically. Abortion is a most serious matter and should be considered only after the persons involved have consulted with their local church leaders and feel through personal prayer that their decision is correct.</p>
<p data-aid="146040018" id="note10_p7">&#201C;The Church has not favored or opposed legislative proposals or public demonstrations concerning abortion&#201D; (&#201C;<a href="https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/official-statement/abortion">Abortion</a>,&#201D; Newsroom, newsroom.ChurchofJesusChrist.org; see also <a class="cross-ref" href="/study/manual/general-handbook/38-church-policies-and-guidelines?lang=eng&amp;para=title98#title98"><cite>General Handbook: Serving in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</cite></a>, 38.6.1, ChurchofJesusChrist.org).]</span></sup> &#2026; You are the mothers of the sons and daughters of God, whose lives are sacred.

<p data-aid="146040074" id="note11_p4">&#201C;But such instances are rare, and there is only a negligible probability of their occurring.

<p data-aid="146039668" id="p13">Elder Marcus&nbsp;B. Nash shared with me the story of a dear 84-year-old woman who, during her baptismal interview, &#201C;acknowledged an abortion [many years before].&#201D; With heartfelt emotion, she said: &#201C;I have carried the burden of having aborted a child every day of my life for forty-six years. &#2026; Nothing I did would take the pain and guilt away. I was hopeless until I was taught the true gospel of Jesus Christ. I learned how to repent &#2026; and suddenly I was filled with hope. I finally came to know that I could be forgiven if I truly repented of my sins.&#201D;<sup class="noteMarker"><a href="#note12">12</a><span class="footnote">[See Neil&nbsp;L.

<p data-aid="146040097" id="note12_p1">On one occasion in France, during a baptismal interview, a woman spoke to me of her abortion of many years before. I was grateful for her goodness. She was baptized. About a year later, I received a phone call. This wonderful woman in the year since her baptism had been taught by the Holy Ghost. She called, sobbing: &#201C;Do you remember &#2026; I told you about an abortion from years before? I felt sorry for what I had done. But [this] past year has changed me. &#2026; My heart has been turned to the Savior. &#2026; I am so pained by the seriousness of my sin that I have no way to restore.&#201D;</p>
<p data-aid="146040105" id="note12_p2">I felt the Lord&#2019;s immense love for this woman. President Boyd&nbsp;K. Packer said: &#201C;Restoring what you cannot restore, healing the wound you cannot heal, fixing that which you broke and you cannot fix is the very purpose of the atonement of Christ. When your desire is firm and you are willing to pay the ‘uttermost farthing&#2019; [see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/matt/5.25-26?lang=eng#p25">Matthew 5:25&#2013;26</a>], the law of restitution is suspended.

I assured her of the Savior&#2019;s love. The Lord not only lifted the sin from her; He strengthened and refined her spirit. (See Neil&nbsp;L.

</header>
<p data-aid="146039712" id="p17">In our family, we have been immeasurably blessed as two decades ago, a young 16-year-old learned that she was expecting a child. She and the baby&#2019;s father were not married, and they could see no way forward together. The young woman believed the life she was carrying was precious. She gave birth to a baby girl and allowed a righteous family to adopt her as their own. For Bryce and Jolinne, she was an answer to their prayers. They named her Emily and taught her to trust in her Heavenly Father and in His Son, Jesus Christ.</p>

<p data-aid="146039719" id="p18">Emily grew up. How grateful we are that Emily and our grandson, Christian, fell in love and were married in the house of the Lord. Emily and Christian now have their own little girl.</p>

<p data-aid="146039727" id="p19">Emily recently wrote: &#201C;Throughout these last nine months of pregnancy, I had time to reflect on the events [of] my own birth. I thought of my birth mother, who was just 16 years old. As I experienced the aches and changes that pregnancy brings, I couldn&#2019;t help but imagine how difficult it would have been at the young age of 16. &#2026; The tears flow even now as I think of my birth mother, who knew she couldn&#2019;t give me the life [she desired for me and unselfishly placed] me for adoption. I can&#2019;t fathom what she might have gone through in those nine months&#2014;being watched with judging eyes as her body changed, the teen experiences she missed, knowing that at the end of this labor of motherly love, she would place her child into the arms of another. I am so thankful for her selfless choice, that she did not choose to use her agency in a way that would take away my own.&#201D; Emily concludes, &#201C;I&#2019;m so thankful for Heavenly Father&#2019;s divine plan, for my incredible parents who [loved and cared for] me, and for temples where we can be sealed to our families for eternity.&#201D;<sup class="noteMarker"><a href="#note15">15</a><span class="footnote">[Personal correspondence.]</span></sup></p>

As you receive these precious children in the Savior&#2019;s name and help them in their eternal journey, I promise you that the Lord will bless you and shower His love and approval upon you. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.</p>

<p data-aid="146039939" id="note10_p1">The official position of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints:</p>
<p data-aid="146039950" id="note10_p8">&#201C;The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints believes in the sanctity of human life. Therefore, the Church opposes elective abortion for personal or social convenience, and counsels its members not to submit to, perform, encourage, pay for, or arrange for such abortions.</p>
<p data-aid="146039961" id="note10_p2">&#201C;The Church allows for possible exceptions for its members when:</p>
<p data-aid="146039972" id="note10_p3">&#201C;Pregnancy results from rape or incest, or</p>
<p data-aid="146039989" id="note10_p4">&#201C;A competent physician determines that the life or health of the mother is in serious jeopardy, or</p>
<p data-aid="146039996" id="note10_p5">&#201C;A competent physician determines that the fetus has severe defects that will not allow the baby to survive beyond birth.</p>
<p data-aid="146040006" id="note10_p6">&#201C;The Church teaches its members that even these rare exceptions do not justify abortion automatically. Abortion is a most serious matter and should be considered only after the persons involved have consulted with their local church leaders and feel through personal prayer that their decision is correct.</p>
<p data-aid="146040018" id="note10_p7">&#201C;The Church has not favored or opposed legislative proposals or public demonstrations concerning abortion&#201D; (&#201C;<a href="https://newsroom.churchofjesuschrist.org/official-statement/abortion">Abortion</a>,&#201D; Newsroom, newsroom.ChurchofJesusChrist.org; see also <a class="cross-ref" href="/study/manual/general-handbook/38-church-policies-and-guidelines?lang=eng&amp;para=title98#title98"><cite>General Handbook: Serving in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</cite></a>, 38.6.1, ChurchofJesusChrist.org).</p></li>

<p data-aid="146040041" id="note11_p2">President Gordon&nbsp;B. Hinckley said:</p>
<p data-aid="146040056" id="note11_p5">&#201C;Abortion is an ugly thing, a debasing thing, a thing which inevitably brings remorse and sorrow and regret.</p>
<p data-aid="146040070" id="note11_p3">&#201C;While we denounce it, we make allowance in such circumstances as when pregnancy is the result of incest or rape, when the life or health of the mother is judged by competent medical authority to be in serious jeopardy, or when the fetus is known by competent medical authority to have serious defects that will not allow the baby to survive beyond birth.</p>
<p data-aid="146040074" id="note11_p4">&#201C;But such instances are rare, and there is only a negligible probability of their occurring. In these circumstances those who face the question are asked to consult with their local ecclesiastical leaders and to pray in great earnestness, receiving a confirmation through prayer before proceeding&#201D; (&#201C;<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/general-conference/1998/10/what-are-people-asking-about-us?lang=eng">What Are People Asking about Us?</a>,&#201D; <cite>Ensign</cite>, Nov. 1998, 71; <cite>Liahona</cite>, Jan. 1999, 83&#2013;84).</p></li>

<p data-aid="146040097" id="note12_p1">On one occasion in France, during a baptismal interview, a woman spoke to me of her abortion of many years before. I was grateful for her goodness. She was baptized. About a year later, I received a phone call. This wonderful woman in the year since her baptism had been taught by the Holy Ghost. She called, sobbing: &#201C;Do you remember &#2026; I told you about an abortion from years before? I felt sorry for what I had done. But [this] past year has changed me. &#2026; My heart has been turned to the Savior. &#2026; I am so pained by the seriousness of my sin that I have no way to restore.&#201D;</p>
<p data-aid="146040105" id="note12_p2">I felt the Lord&#2019;s immense love for this woman. President Boyd&nbsp;K. Packer said: &#201C;Restoring what you cannot restore, healing the wound you cannot heal, fixing that which you broke and you cannot fix is the very purpose of the atonement of Christ. When your desire is firm and you are willing to pay the ‘uttermost farthing&#2019; [see <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/matt/5.25-26?lang=eng#p25">Matthew 5:25&#2013;26</a>], the law of restitution is suspended. Your obligation is transferred to the Lord. He will settle your accounts&#201D; (&#201C;<a class="cross-ref" href="/study/general-conference/1995/10/the-brilliant-morning-of-forgiveness?lang=eng">The Brilliant Morning of Forgiveness</a>,&#201D; <cite>Ensign</cite>, Nov. 1995, 19&#2013;20). I assured her of the Savior&#2019;s love. The Lord not only lifted the sin from her; He strengthened and refined her spirit. (See Neil&nbsp;L.
