<p data-aid="146038311" id="p2">Before I reached my 12th birthday, our family had been forced twice to flee our home and start over amid the chaos, fear, and uncertainties caused by war and political division. It was an anxious time for me, but it must have been terrifying for my beloved parents.</p>
<p data-aid="146038313" id="p3">My mother and father shared little about this burden with us four children. They bore the strain and suffering as best they could. The fear must have been oppressive, consuming their hours and dampening their hope.</p>
<p data-aid="146038315" id="p4">This time of bleakness after World War II left its mark upon the world. It left its mark upon me.</p>
<p data-aid="146038317" id="p5">Back then, in the solitude of my loneliest hours, I often wondered, &#201C;Is there any hope left in the world?&#201D;</p>

</header>
<p data-aid="146038321" id="p6">As I pondered this question, I thought about our young American missionaries who served among us during those years. They had left the safety of their homes half a world away and traveled to Germany&#2014;land of their recent enemies&#2014;to offer divine hope to our people. They came not to blame, lecture, or shame. They willingly gave of their young lives without thought of earthly gain, wanting only to help others find the joy and peace they had experienced.</p>
<p data-aid="146038323" id="p7">To me, these young men and women were perfect. I am sure they had flaws, but not to me. I will always think of them as being bigger than life&#2014;angels of light and glory, ministers of compassion, goodness, and truth.</p>
<p data-aid="146038325" id="p8">While the world was drowning in cynicism, bitterness, hatred, and fear, the example and teachings of these young people filled me with hope. The gospel message they offered transcended politics, history, grudges, grievances, and personal agendas. It gave divine answers to important questions we had during these difficult times.</p>
<p data-aid="146038327" id="p9">The message was that God lived and cared about us, even in these hours of turmoil, confusion, and chaos. That He actually appeared in our time to restore truth and light&#2014;His gospel and His Church. That He speaks to prophets again; that God is among us&#2014;and is personally involved in our lives and actively guiding His children.</p>
<p data-aid="146038329" id="p10">It is astonishing what we can learn when we look a little closer at our Heavenly Father&#2019;s plan of salvation and exaltation, the plan of happiness, for His children. When we feel insignificant, cast off, and forgotten, we learn that we may be assured that God has not forgotten us&#2014;in fact, that He offers to all His children something unimaginable: to become &#201C;heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ.&#201D;<sup class="noteMarker"><a href="#note2">2</a><span class="footnote">[<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/rom/8.17?lang=eng#p17">Romans 8:17</a>; see also <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/84.38?lang=eng#p38">Doctrine and Covenants 84:38</a>.]</span></sup></p>

<p data-aid="146038353" id="p25">I often have wondered, What would Jesus teach and do if He were among us today?</p>

<p data-aid="146038357" id="p27">The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ speaks of such an appearance to the people on the American continent. We have this precious record as a tangible witness of the Savior&#2019;s work.</p>
<p data-aid="146038359" id="p28">The people of the Book of Mormon lived on the other side of the globe&#2014;their histories, cultures, and political climates were vastly different from the people Jesus taught during His mortal ministry. And yet He taught them many of the same things He taught in the Holy Land.</p>
<p data-aid="146038361" id="p29">Why would He do that?</p>
<p data-aid="146038363" id="p30">The Savior always teaches timeless truths. They apply to people of every age and in any circumstance.</p>
<p data-aid="146038366" id="p31">His message was and is a message of hope and belonging&#2014;a testimony that God our Heavenly Father has not abandoned His children.</p>
<p data-aid="146038367" id="p32">That God is among us!</p>
<p data-aid="146038371" id="p33">Two hundred years ago, the Savior again returned to earth. Together with God the Father, He appeared to a 14-year-old Joseph Smith and ushered in the Restoration of the gospel and the Church of Jesus Christ. From that day forward, the heavens opened, and heavenly messengers descended from halls of immortal glory. Light and knowledge poured forth from the celestial throne.</p>
<p data-aid="146038373" id="p34">The Lord Jesus Christ spoke once again to the world.</p>
<p data-aid="146038376" id="p35">What did He say?</p>
<p data-aid="146038380" id="p36">To our blessing, many of His words are recorded in the Doctrine and Covenants&#2014;available to anyone in the world who wishes to read and study them. How priceless are these words to us today!</p>
