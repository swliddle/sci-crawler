<p data-aid="146039062" id="p1">In 1994, a genocide took place in the East African country of Rwanda that was partly due to deep-seated tribal tensions. Estimates are that more than half a million people were killed.<sup class="noteMarker"><a href="#note1">1</a><span class="footnote">[See John Reader, <cite>Africa: A Biography of the Continent</cite> (1999), 635&#2013;36, 673&#2013;79.]</span></sup> Remarkably, the Rwandan people have in large part reconciled,<sup class="noteMarker"><a href="#note2">2</a><span class="footnote">[Though hopeful, the Rwandan reconciliation is complex. Some question its depth and durability. See, for example, &#201C;The Great Rwanda Debate: Paragon or Prison?,&#201D; <cite>Economist</cite>, Mar. 27, 2021, 41&#2013;43.]</span></sup> but these events continue to reverberate. </p>
<p data-aid="146039067" id="p2">A decade ago, while visiting Rwanda, my wife and I struck up a conversation with another passenger at the Kigali airport. He lamented the unfairness of the genocide and poignantly asked, &#201C;If there were a God, wouldn&#2019;t He have done something about it?&#201D; For this man&#2014;and for many of us&#2014;suffering and brutal unfairness can seem incompatible with the reality of a kind, loving Heavenly Father. Yet He is real, He is kind, and He loves each of His children perfectly. This dichotomy is as old as mankind and cannot be explained in a simple sound bite or on a bumper sticker.</p>
<p data-aid="146039072" id="p3">To begin to make some sense of it, let us explore various types of unfairness. Consider a family in which each child received a weekly monetary allowance for doing common household chores. One son, John, purchased candy; one daughter, Anna, saved her money. Eventually, Anna bought herself a bicycle. John thought it was totally unfair that Anna got a bike when he did not. But John&#2019;s choices created the inequality, not parental actions. Anna&#2019;s decision to forgo the immediate gratification of eating candy did not impose any unfairness on John, because he had the same opportunity as his sister. </p>
<p data-aid="146039075" id="p4">Our decisions can likewise yield long-term advantages or disadvantages. As the Lord revealed, &#201C;If a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life <em>through his diligence and obedience</em> than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come.&#201D;<sup class="noteMarker"><a href="#note3">3</a><span class="footnote">[<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/130.19?lang=eng#p19">Doctrine and Covenants 130:19</a>; emphasis added.]</span></sup> When others receive benefits because of their diligent choices, we cannot rightly conclude that we have been treated unfairly when we have had the same opportunity. </p>
<p data-aid="146039083" id="p5">Another example of unfairness stems from a situation my wife, Ruth, encountered as a child. One day Ruth learned that her mother was taking a younger sister, Merla, to buy new shoes. Ruth complained, &#201C;Mom, it&#2019;s so unfair! Merla got the last new pair of shoes.&#201D;</p>
<p data-aid="146039087" id="p22">Ruth&#2019;s mother asked, &#201C;Ruth, do your shoes fit?&#201D;</p>
<p data-aid="146039092" id="p23">Ruth replied, &#201C;Well, yes.&#201D;</p>
<p data-aid="146039098" id="p24">Ruth&#2019;s mother then said, &#201C;Merla&#2019;s shoes no longer fit.&#201D;</p>
<p data-aid="146039103" id="p25">Ruth agreed that every child in the family should have shoes that fit. Although Ruth would have liked new shoes, her perception of being treated unfairly dissipated when she saw the circumstances through her mother&#2019;s eyes. </p>
<p data-aid="146039108" id="p6">Some unfairness cannot be explained; inexplicable unfairness is infuriating. Unfairness comes from living with bodies that are imperfect, injured, or diseased. Mortal life is inherently unfair. Some people are born in affluence; others are not. Some have loving parents; others do not. Some live many years; others, few. And on and on and on. Some individuals make injurious mistakes even when they are trying to do good. Some choose not to alleviate unfairness when they could. Distressingly, some individuals use their God-given agency to hurt others when they never should. </p>
<p data-aid="146039115" id="p7">Different types of unfairness can merge, creating a tsunami of overwhelming unfairness. For instance, the COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately affects those who already are subject to multifactorial, underlying disadvantages. My heart aches for those who face such unfairness, but I declare with all my aching heart that Jesus Christ both understands unfairness and has the power to provide a remedy. Nothing compares to the unfairness He endured. It was not fair that He experienced all the pains and afflictions of mankind. It was not fair that He suffered for my sins and mistakes and for yours. But He chose to do so because of His love for us and for Heavenly Father. He understands perfectly what we are experiencing.<sup class="noteMarker"><a href="#note4">4</a><span class="footnote">[See <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/heb/4.15?lang=eng#p15">Hebrews 4:15</a>.]</span></sup> </p>
<p data-aid="146039122" id="p8">Scripture records that ancient Israelites complained that God was treating them unfairly. In response, Jehovah asked, &#201C;For can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb?&#201D; As unlikely as it is that a loving mother would forget her infant child, Jehovah declared that His devotion was even more steadfast. He affirmed: &#201C;Yea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee. &#2026; Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy walls are continually before me.&#201D;<sup class="noteMarker"><a href="#note5">5</a><span class="footnote">[<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/21.15-16?lang=eng#p15">1&nbsp;Nephi 21:15&#2013;16</a>.]</span></sup> Because Jesus Christ endured the infinite atoning sacrifice, He empathizes perfectly with us.<sup class="noteMarker"><a href="#note6">6</a><span class="footnote">[See <a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/7.11-13?lang=eng#p11">Alma 7:11&#2013;13</a>.]</span></sup> He is always aware of us and our circumstances. </p>

As we learn to recognize these blessings, our trust in God will increase. In the eternities, Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ will resolve all unfairness. We understandably want to know <em>how</em> and <em>when</em>. <em>How</em> are They going to do that? <em>When</em> are They going to do it?

<p data-aid="146039157" id="p13">Someone who has been anxiously engaged in combating unfairness is attorney Bryan Stevenson. His legal practice in the United States is dedicated to defending the wrongly accused, ending excessive punishment, and protecting basic human rights. Some years ago, Mr. Stevenson defended a man who had been falsely accused of murder and was condemned to die. Mr. Stevenson asked the man&#2019;s local Christian church for support, even though the man was not active in his church and was disparaged in the community due to a widely known extramarital affair. </p>
<p data-aid="146039163" id="p14">To focus the congregation on what really mattered, Mr. Stevenson spoke to them about the woman accused of adultery who was brought to Jesus.
