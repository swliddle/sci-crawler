<p data-aid="146040224" id="p1">My dear brothers and sisters, I rejoice with you on this blessed Easter Sunday in contemplating the glorious light that dawned on the earth with the Resurrection of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.</p>
<p data-aid="146040229" id="p2">During His mortal ministry, Jesus declared, &#201C;I am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.&#201D;<sup class="noteMarker"><a href="#note1">1</a><span class="footnote">[<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/john/8.12?lang=eng#p12">John 8:12</a>.]</span></sup> The Spirit of Christ &#201C;is in all things [and] giveth life to all things.&#201D;<sup class="noteMarker"><a href="#note2">2</a><span class="footnote">[<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.13?lang=eng#p13">Doctrine and Covenants 88:13</a>.]</span></sup> It conquers the darkness that otherwise would surround us.</p>
<p data-aid="146040233" id="p3">Years ago, in search of adventure, my two sons and I accompanied a Young Men group to the Moaning Cavern, so named for a sound that at one time echoed out of its mouth. The cavern is a chimney cave which opens into a 180-foot-deep (55&nbsp;m) vertical chamber, the largest single-cave chamber in California.</p>

<p data-aid="146040235" id="p4">There are only two ways down: the safe circular staircase or rappelling to the cavern&#2019;s floor; my sons and I chose to rappel. My older son went first, while my younger son and I purposely went last so that we would descend together.</p>
<p data-aid="146040238" id="p5">After our guides instructed and secured us with harness and belay gear to a strong rope, we inched backward until we stood on a small ledge and gathered our confidence, as this was the last place to turn around and the last place we could see any sunlight from the mouth of the cave.</p>
<p data-aid="146040243" id="p6">Our next step backwards plunged us into a cathedral cavern so tall and wide that it could swallow the Statue of Liberty. There we dangled in a slow spin as our eyes adjusted to the relative darkness. As we continued our descent, the glow of electric lights illuminated an amazing wall of glistening stalagmites and stalactites.</p>
<p data-aid="146040245" id="p7">Without warning, the lights suddenly went completely out. Suspended above the abyss, we were engulfed in a darkness so profound that we could not even see our hands on the ropes in front of us. A voice instantly called out, &#201C;Dad, Dad, are you there?&#201D;</p>
<p data-aid="146040250" id="p32">&#201C;I&#2019;m here, Son; I&#2019;m right here,&#201D; I responded.</p>
<p data-aid="146040252" id="p8">The unexpected loss of light was designed to show that without electricity, the darkness of the cavern was impenetrable. It succeeded; we &#201C;felt&#201D; the darkness. When the lights did return, the darkness instantly surrendered, as darkness must always surrender, to even the faintest light. My sons and I have been left with a memory of a darkness we had never known, a greater appreciation for light we will never forget, and the assurance that we are never all alone in the dark.</p>
<p data-aid="146040253" id="p9">Our descent into that cavern in some ways parallels our journey through mortality. We departed from the glorious light of heaven and descended through a veil of forgetfulness to a darkened world. Our Heavenly Father did not abandon us to darkness but promised us light for our journey through His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ.</p>
<p data-aid="146040255" id="p10">We know that sunlight is vital to all life on earth. Equally vital to our spiritual life is the light that emanates from our Savior.

<p data-aid="146040279" id="p24">I come from goodly parents and from faithful ancestors who responded to the light of Jesus Christ and His gospel, and it blessed their lives and the generations that have followed with spiritual resilience. My dad often talked about his father, Milo&nbsp;T Dyches, and shared how his faith in God was a light to him day and night. Grandpa was a forest ranger and often rode alone in the mountains, entrusting his life without question to God&#2019;s direction and care.</p>
<p data-aid="146040281" id="p25">Late one fall, Grandpa was alone in the high mountains. Winter had already shown its face when he saddled one of his favorite horses, old Prince, and rode to a sawmill to scale and measure logs before they could be sawed into lumber.</p>
<p data-aid="146040283" id="p26">At dusk, he finished his work and climbed back into the saddle. By then, the temperature had plummeted, and a fierce winter snowstorm was engulfing the mountain. With neither light nor path to guide him, he turned Prince in a direction he thought would lead them back to the ranger station.</p>

<p data-aid="146040285" id="p27">After traveling miles in the dark, Prince slowed, then stopped. Grandpa repeatedly urged Prince forward, but the horse refused. With blinding snow swirling around them, Grandpa realized he needed God&#2019;s help. As he had done throughout his life, he humbly &#201C;ask[ed] in faith, nothing wavering.&#201D;<sup class="noteMarker"><a href="#note24">24</a><span class="footnote">[<a class="scripture-ref" href="/study/scriptures/nt/james/1.6?lang=eng#p6">James 1:6</a>.]</span></sup> A still, small voice answered, &#201C;Milo, give Prince his head.&#201D; Grandpa obeyed, and as he lightened his hold on the reins, Prince swung around and plodded off in a different direction. Hours later, Prince again halted and lowered his head. Through the driving snow, Grandpa saw that they had safely arrived at the gate of the ranger station.</p>
<p data-aid="146040287" id="p28">With the morning sun, Grandpa retraced the faint tracks of Prince in the snow. He drew a deep breath when he found where he had given Prince his head: it was the very brink of a lofty mountain cliff, where a single step forward would have plunged both horse and rider to their deaths in the rugged rocks below.</p>
<p data-aid="146040289" id="p29">Based on that experience and many others, Grandpa counseled, &#201C;The best and greatest partner you will ever have is your Father in Heaven.&#201D; When my dad would relate Grandpa&#2019;s story, I remember that he would quote from the scriptures:</p>
<p data-aid="146040290" id="p33">&#201C;Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.</p>
