Accidental conversion is not a principle of the gospel of Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n<\/header>\n<div class=\"body-block\">\n<p data-aid=\"146038281\" id=\"p1\">Have you ever wondered why we call Primary \u201cPrimary\u201d? While the name refers to spiritual learning children receive in their earliest years, to me it is also a reminder of a powerful truth. To our Heavenly Father, children have <em>never<\/em> been secondary\u2014they have <em>always <\/em>been \u201cprimary.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\">1<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146038282\" id=\"p2\">He trusts us to value, respect, and protect them as children of God. That means we never harm them physically, verbally, or emotionally in any way, even when tensions and pressures run high. Instead we <em>value<\/em> children, and we do all we can to combat the evils of abuse. Their care is primary to us\u2014as it is to Him.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\">2<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146038283\" id=\"p3\">One young mother and father sat at their kitchen table reviewing their day. From down the hall, they heard a thud. The mother asked, \u201cWhat was that?\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146038284\" id=\"p4\">Then they heard a soft cry coming from their four-year-old son\u2019s bedroom. They rushed down the hall. There he was, lying on the floor next to his bed. The mother picked up the little boy and asked him what had happened.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146038285\" id=\"p5\">He said, \u201cI fell out of bed.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146038286\" id=\"p6\">She said, \u201cWhy did you fall out of bed?\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146038287\" id=\"p7\">He shrugged and said, \u201cI don\u2019t know. I guess I just didn\u2019t get far enough in.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146038288\" id=\"p8\">It is about this \u201cgetting far enough in\u201d that I would like to speak this morning. It is our privilege and responsibility to help children \u201cget far enough in\u201d to the gospel of Jesus Christ. And we cannot begin too soon.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146038289\" id=\"p9\">There is a uniquely special time in children\u2019s lives when they are protected from Satan\u2019s influence. It is a time when they are innocent and sin free.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\">3<\/sup><\/a> It is a sacred time for parent and child. Children are to be taught, by word and example, before and after they have \u201carrived unto the years of accountability before God.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\">4<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146038290\" id=\"p10\">President Henry&nbsp;B. Eyring taught: \u201cWe have the greatest opportunity with the young. The best time to teach is early, while children are still immune to the temptations of [the] mortal enemy, and long before the words of truth may be harder for them to hear in the noise of their personal struggles.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\">5<\/sup><\/a> Such teaching will help them realize their divine identity, their purpose, and the rich blessings that await them as they make sacred covenants and receive ordinances along the covenant path.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146038291\" id=\"p11\">We cannot wait for conversion to simply happen to our children. Accidental conversion is <em>not<\/em> a principle of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Becoming like our Savior will not happen randomly. Being intentional in loving, teaching, and testifying can help children begin at a young age to feel the influence of the Holy Ghost.

Family members can act out situations of being tempted or pressured to make a bad choice. Such an exercise can fortify children to be prepared in a challenging setting. For example, we can act it out and then talk it out as we ask children what they would do:<\/p>\n<ul class=\"bullet\">\n<li>\n<p data-aid=\"146038306\" id=\"p26\">If they are tempted to break the Word of Wisdom.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p data-aid=\"146038308\" id=\"p27\">If they are exposed to pornography.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p data-aid=\"146038310\" id=\"p28\">If they are tempted to lie, steal, or cheat.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li>\n<p data-aid=\"146038312\" id=\"p29\">If they hear something from a friend or teacher at school that disputes their beliefs or values.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p data-aid=\"146038314\" id=\"p30\">As they act it out and then talk it out, rather than being caught unprepared in a hostile peer group setting, children can be armed with \u201cthe shield of faith wherewith [they] shall be able to quench <em>all<\/em> the fiery darts of the wicked.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note14\"><sup class=\"marker\">14<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146038316\" id=\"p31\">A close personal friend learned this crucial lesson as an 18-year-old. He enlisted in the United States military during the conflict between the United States and Vietnam. He was assigned to basic training in the infantry to become a foot soldier. He explained that the training was grueling. He described his drill instructor as cruel and inhumane.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146038318\" id=\"p32\">One particular day his squad was dressed in full battle gear, hiking in sweltering heat. The drill instructor suddenly shouted orders to drop to the ground and not move. The instructor was watching for even the <em>slightest<\/em> motion. Any movement would result in serious consequences later on. The squad suffered for more than two hours in the heat with growing anger and resentment toward their leader.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146038320\" id=\"p33\">Many months later our friend found himself leading his squad through the jungles of Vietnam. This was real, not just training. Shots began to ring from high in the surrounding trees. The entire squad immediately dropped to the ground.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146038322\" id=\"p34\">What was the enemy looking for? Movement. Any motion at all would draw fire. My friend said that as he lay sweating and motionless on the jungle floor, waiting for dark for several long hours, his thoughts reflected back on basic training. He remembered his intense dislike for his drill instructor. Now he felt intense gratitude\u2014for what he had taught him and how he had prepared him for this critical situation. The drill instructor had wisely equipped our friend and his squad with the ability to know what to do when the battle was raging. He had, in effect, saved our friend\u2019s life.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146038324\" id=\"p35\">How can we do the same for our children spiritually?

The prophet Jacob seemed to voice these same feelings when he said: \u201cI am desirous for the welfare of your souls. Yea, mine anxiety is great for you; and ye yourselves know that it ever has been.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note16\"><sup class=\"marker\">16<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146038328\" id=\"p37\">As children learn and progress, their beliefs will be challenged.

It comes from two Latin roots: <em>in<\/em>, meaning \u2018within\u2019; and <em>oculus<\/em>, meaning \u2018an eye.\u2019 The verb <em>to inoculate<\/em>, therefore, literally means \u2018to put an eye within\u2019\u2014to monitor against harm.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039490\" id=\"note15_p2\">\u201cAn affliction like polio can cripple or destroy the body. An affliction like sin can cripple or destroy the spirit. The ravages of polio can now be prevented by immunization, but the ravages of sin require other means of prevention. Doctors cannot immunize against iniquity. Spiritual protection comes only from the Lord\u2014and in his own way. Jesus chooses not to inoculate, but to indoctrinate. His method employs no vaccine; it utilizes the teaching of divine doctrine\u2014a governing \u2018eye within\u2019\u2014to protect the eternal spirits of his children.\u201d<\/p>",

His well-marshaled forces are legion. Our children and youth are the targets of his main thrust. They are everywhere subjected to wicked and vicious propaganda. Every place they turn, they are buffeted with evil, cunningly devised to deceive and to destroy every sacred thing and every righteous principle. \u2026 If our children are to be sufficiently strengthened to stand against this satanic onslaught, they must be taught and trained in the home, as the Lord has directed.\u201d<\/p>",
