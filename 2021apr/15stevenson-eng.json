Over several months, they fed a control group of rabbits a high-fat diet and monitored their blood pressure, heart rate, and cholesterol.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146038933\" id=\"p4\">As expected, many of the rabbits showed a buildup of fatty deposits on the inside of their arteries. Yet this was not all! Researchers had discovered something that made little sense. Although all of the rabbits had a buildup, one group surprisingly had as much as 60 percent less than the others. It appeared as though they were looking at two different groups of rabbits.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146038934\" id=\"p5\">To scientists, results like this can cause lost sleep. How could this be? The rabbits were all the same breed from New Zealand, from a virtually identical gene pool. They each received equal amounts of the same food.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146038935\" id=\"p6\">What could this mean?<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146038936\" id=\"p7\">Did the results invalidate the study? Were there flaws in the experiment design?<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146038937\" id=\"p8\">The scientists struggled to understand this unexpected outcome!<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146038938\" id=\"p9\">Eventually, they turned their attention to the research staff. Was it possible that researchers had done something to influence the results? As they pursued this, they discovered that every rabbit with fewer fatty deposits had been under the care of one researcher. She fed the rabbits the same food as everyone else. But, as one scientist reported, \u201cshe was an unusually kind and caring individual.\u201d When she fed the rabbits, \u201cshe talked to them, cuddled and petted them. \u2026 \u2018She couldn\u2019t help it. It\u2019s just how she was.\u2019\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\">1<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<img id=\"img5\" src=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/cb/67/cb679f29a715a81db9f368f95201f4c22cad2db3/woman_looking_bunny_rabbit.png\" data-img-id=\"f5c0c4040f8b0274d70a9f595007749d07c2d69f\" srcset=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/5d/c5/5dc54866e2db4a0532b3f4f4274e1e9d4d57bc6d/woman_looking_bunny_rabbit.png 60w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/e0/a7/e0a7021ea475e9efd98eea5d2ba45609e6dd8c6b/woman_looking_bunny_rabbit.png 100w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/20/43/2043a0c5602b722d08e54f978d77287700125c66/woman_looking_bunny_rabbit.png 200w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/1a/b0/1ab04a16131afbba24f6b3e2e2de377208baa57f/woman_looking_bunny_rabbit.png 250w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/a0/b5/a0b56cf8f6015db158de5760d41c5d9953ccb543/woman_looking_bunny_rabbit.png 320w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/cb/67/cb679f29a715a81db9f368f95201f4c22cad2db3/woman_looking_bunny_rabbit.png 500w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/e6/3c/e63cfafd75abd5a7cc3043fb7c60157eed513e1d/woman_looking_bunny_rabbit.png 640w\" data-assetid=\"f5c0c4040f8b0274d70a9f595007749d07c2d69f\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" alt=\"Woman Looking at Bunny Rabbit\">\n<p data-aid=\"146038940\" id=\"p10\">She did more than simply give the rabbits food. She gave them love!<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146038941\" id=\"p11\">At first glance, it seemed unlikely that this could be the reason for the dramatic difference, but the research team could see no other possibility.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146038943\" id=\"p12\">So they repeated the experiment\u2014this time tightly controlling for every other variable. When they analyzed the results, the same thing happened! The rabbits under the care of the loving researcher had significantly higher health outcomes.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146038945\" id=\"p13\">The scientists published the results of this study in the prestigious journal <cite>Science<\/cite>.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\">2<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146038949\" id=\"p14\">Years later the findings of this experiment still seem influential in the medical community. In recent years, Dr. Kelli Harding published a book titled <cite>The Rabbit Effect<\/cite> that takes its name from the experiment. Her conclusion: \u201cTake a rabbit with an unhealthy lifestyle. Talk to it. Hold it. Give it affection. \u2026 The relationship made a difference. \u2026 Ultimately,\u201d she concludes, \u201cwhat affects our health in the most meaningful ways has as much to do with how we treat one another, how we live, and how we think about what it means to be human.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\">3<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146038950\" id=\"p16\">In a secular world, bridges connecting science with gospel truths sometimes seem few and far between. Yet as Christians, followers of Jesus Christ, Latter-day Saints, the results of this scientific study may seem more intuitive than astonishing. For me, this lays another brick in the foundation of kindness as a fundamental, healing gospel principle\u2014one that can heal hearts emotionally, spiritually, and, as demonstrated here, even physically.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"146038952\" id=\"title3\">Hearts Knit Together<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"146038953\" id=\"p17\">When asked, \u201cMaster, which is the great commandment?\u201d the Savior replied to \u201clove the Lord thy God with all thy heart,\u201d followed by, \u201cThou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\">4<\/sup><\/a> The Savior\u2019s response reinforces our heavenly duty.

The next day I went up to him and put my arm around his shoulder and apologized, saying, \u2018I\u2019m really sorry that I made fun of you.\u2019 He nodded at my words, and his eyes filled up with tears.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146038983\" id=\"p28\">\u201cBut the other kids were still making fun of him.

We have a primary responsibility to set a tone and be role models of kindness, inclusion, and civility\u2014to teach Christlike behavior to the rising generation in what we say and how we act. It is especially important as we observe a marked societal shift toward division in politics, social class, and nearly every other man-made distinction.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039018\" id=\"p35\">President M.&nbsp;Russell Ballard has also taught that Latter-day Saints must be kind not only to each other but also to everyone around us. He observed: \u201cOccasionally I hear of members offending those of other faiths by overlooking them and leaving them out. This can occur especially in communities where our members are the majority. I have heard about narrow-minded parents who tell children that they cannot play with a particular child in the neighborhood simply because his or her family does not belong to our Church. This kind of behavior is not in keeping with the teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ. I cannot comprehend why any member of our Church would allow these kinds of things to happen. \u2026 I have never heard the members of this Church urged to be anything but loving, kind, tolerant, and benevolent to our friends and neighbors of other faiths.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\">11<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039022\" id=\"p36\">The Lord expects us to teach that inclusion is a positive means toward unity and that exclusion leads to division.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039023\" id=\"p37\">As followers of Jesus Christ, we are dismayed when we hear of how children of God are mistreated based on their race. We have been heartbroken to hear of recent attacks on people who are Black, Asian, Latino, or of any other group. Prejudice, racial tension, or violence should never have any place in our neighborhoods, communities, or within the Church.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039027\" id=\"p38\">Let each of us, no matter our age, strive to be our best.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"146039031\" id=\"title4\">Love Your Enemy<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"146039035\" id=\"p39\">As you strive to extend yourself in love, respect, and kindness, you will undoubtedly be hurt or negatively affected by the bad choices of others.

During the winter of 1838, Joseph Smith and other Church leaders were detained in Liberty Jail when the Latter-day Saints were forcibly driven from their homes in the state of Missouri. The Saints were destitute, friendless, and suffering greatly from the cold and lack of resources. The residents of Quincy, Illinois, saw their desperate plight and reached out in compassion and friendship.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039049\" id=\"p42\">Wandle Mace, a resident of Quincy, later recalled when he first saw the Saints along the Mississippi River in makeshift tents: \u201cSome had sheets stretched, to make a little shelter from the wind, \u2026 the children were shivering around a fire which the wind blew about so it done them very little good. The poor Saints were suffering terribly.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\">13<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039054\" id=\"p52\">Seeing the plight of the Saints, Quincy residents rallied together to provide aid, some even assisting in transporting their new friends across the river. Mace continued: \u201c[They] donated liberally; the merchants vying with each other as to which could be the most liberal \u2026 with \u2026 pork, \u2026 sugar, \u2026 shoes and clothing, everything these poor outcasts so much needed.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note14\"><sup class=\"marker\">14<\/sup><\/a> Before long, the refugees outnumbered the Quincy residents, who opened their homes and shared their meager resources at great personal sacrifice.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note15\"><sup class=\"marker\">15<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039059\" id=\"p43\">Many Saints survived the harsh winter only because of the compassion and generosity of the residents of Quincy. These earthly angels opened their hearts and homes, bringing lifesaving nourishment, warmth, and\u2014perhaps most importantly\u2014a hand of friendship to the suffering Saints. Although their stay in Quincy was relatively short, the Saints never forgot their debt of gratitude toward their beloved neighbors, and Quincy became known as the \u201ccity of refuge.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note16\"><sup class=\"marker\">16<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039064\" id=\"p44\">When adversity and affliction are brought upon us by critical, negative, even mean-spirited acts, we can choose to hope in Christ.
