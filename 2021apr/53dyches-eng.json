The cavern is a chimney cave which opens into a 180-foot-deep (55&nbsp;m) vertical chamber, the largest single-cave chamber in California.<\/p>\n<img id=\"img1\" src=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/58/a6/58a6e25efb27a8f8f28a9c236552f396546a8051/moaning_cavern.png\" data-img-id=\"48161747f72e249ab7cc11e910d1b3b740788975\" srcset=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/a4/ae/a4ae7a7acec68db164fcd59829f67148c0c78072/moaning_cavern.png 60w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/0c/ca/0cca2df5d9c2cfd86c2d593a1c2f90b32709fd7e/moaning_cavern.png 100w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/e3/53/e353930eccd1fa72ac39a8d78d15b1ce15053a3d/moaning_cavern.png 200w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/e1/bd/e1bd6932a1e777aedcf91402afde4ec197fe8abb/moaning_cavern.png 250w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/be/67/be6701e1b3f17c524c58122f30ba29aa6ca4a5fd/moaning_cavern.png 320w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/58/a6/58a6e25efb27a8f8f28a9c236552f396546a8051/moaning_cavern.png 500w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/10/8b/108bc253931b5874bae7e63405244593b9d96ed2/moaning_cavern.png 640w\" data-assetid=\"48161747f72e249ab7cc11e910d1b3b740788975\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" alt=\"Moaning Cavern\">\n<p data-aid=\"146040235\" id=\"p4\">There are only two ways down: the safe circular staircase or rappelling to the cavern\u2019s floor; my sons and I chose to rappel. My older son went first, while my younger son and I purposely went last so that we would descend together.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146040238\" id=\"p5\">After our guides instructed and secured us with harness and belay gear to a strong rope, we inched backward until we stood on a small ledge and gathered our confidence, as this was the last place to turn around and the last place we could see any sunlight from the mouth of the cave.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146040243\" id=\"p6\">Our next step backwards plunged us into a cathedral cavern so tall and wide that it could swallow the Statue of Liberty. There we dangled in a slow spin as our eyes adjusted to the relative darkness. As we continued our descent, the glow of electric lights illuminated an amazing wall of glistening stalagmites and stalactites.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146040245\" id=\"p7\">Without warning, the lights suddenly went completely out. Suspended above the abyss, we were engulfed in a darkness so profound that we could not even see our hands on the ropes in front of us. A voice instantly called out, \u201cDad, Dad, are you there?\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146040250\" id=\"p32\">\u201cI\u2019m here, Son; I\u2019m right here,\u201d I responded.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146040252\" id=\"p8\">The unexpected loss of light was designed to show that without electricity, the darkness of the cavern was impenetrable. It succeeded; we \u201cfelt\u201d the darkness. When the lights did return, the darkness instantly surrendered, as darkness must always surrender, to even the faintest light. My sons and I have been left with a memory of a darkness we had never known, a greater appreciation for light we will never forget, and the assurance that we are never all alone in the dark.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146040253\" id=\"p9\">Our descent into that cavern in some ways parallels our journey through mortality. We departed from the glorious light of heaven and descended through a veil of forgetfulness to a darkened world. Our Heavenly Father did not abandon us to darkness but promised us light for our journey through His Beloved Son, Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146040255\" id=\"p10\">We know that sunlight is vital to all life on earth. Equally vital to our spiritual life is the light that emanates from our Savior. In His perfect love, God grants the Light of Christ to every person \u201cthat cometh into the world\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\">3<\/sup><\/a> that they may \u201cknow good from evil\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\">4<\/sup><\/a> and be prompted \u201cto do good continually.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\">5<\/sup><\/a> That light, revealing itself through what we often call our conscience, beckons us ever to act and be better, to be our best self.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146040257\" id=\"p11\">As we intensify our faith in Christ, we receive light in intensifying measure until it dispels all darkness that might gather around us. \u201cThat which is of God is light; and he that receiveth light, and continueth in God, receiveth more light; and that light groweth brighter and brighter until the perfect day.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\">6<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146040258\" id=\"p12\">The Light of Christ prepares us to receive the ministering influence of the Holy Ghost, which is \u201cthe convincing power of God&nbsp;\u2026 of the truth of the Gospel.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\">7<\/sup><\/a> The third member of the Godhead, the Holy Ghost \u201cis a personage of Spirit.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\">8<\/sup><\/a> The greatest source of light that Heavenly Father imparts to you in mortality comes through the Holy Ghost, whose influence \u201cshall enlighten your mind [and] fill your soul with joy.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\">9<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146040260\" id=\"p13\">In The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, through restored priesthood authority, you are baptized by immersion for the remission of sins. Then hands are laid upon your head and this wonderful, \u201cunspeakable gift\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\">10<\/sup><\/a> of the Holy Ghost is bestowed upon you.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146040262\" id=\"p14\">Thereafter, when your desires and actions are centered on the covenant path, the Holy Ghost, as a light within you, will reveal and testify of truth,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\">11<\/sup><\/a> warn of danger, comfort<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\">12<\/sup><\/a> and cleanse,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\">13<\/sup><\/a> and provide peace<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note14\"><sup class=\"marker\">14<\/sup><\/a> to your soul.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146040264\" id=\"p15\">Because \u201clight cleaveth unto light,\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note15\"><sup class=\"marker\">15<\/sup><\/a> the constant companionship of the Holy Ghost will lead you to make choices that will tend to keep you in the light; conversely, choices made without the Holy Ghost\u2019s influence will tend to lead you into shadows and darkness. Elder Robert&nbsp;D. Hales taught: \u201cWhen light is present, darkness is vanquished and must depart.&nbsp;\u2026 When the spiritual light of the Holy Ghost is present, the darkness of Satan departs.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note16\"><sup class=\"marker\">16<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146040265\" id=\"p16\">May I suggest that perhaps this is the time to ask yourself: Do I have that light in my life? If not, when was the last time I did?<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146040267\" id=\"p17\">Just as sunlight daily bathes the earth to renew and sustain life, you can daily brighten the light within you when you choose to follow Him\u2014Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146040269\" id=\"p18\">A drop of sunshine is added every time you seek God in prayer; study the scriptures to \u201chear Him\u201d;<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note17\"><sup class=\"marker\">17<\/sup><\/a> act on guidance and revelation from our living prophets; and obey and keep the commandments to \u201cwalk in all the ordinances of the Lord.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note18\"><sup class=\"marker\">18<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146040271\" id=\"p19\">You will invite spiritual sunlight into your soul and peace into your life each time you repent. As you partake of the sacrament every week to take the Savior\u2019s name upon you, to always remember Him and keep His commandments, His light will shine within you.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146040272\" id=\"p20\">There is sunshine in your soul every time you share the gospel and bear your testimony. Every time you serve one another as the Savior did, His warmth is felt in your heart. Heavenly Father\u2019s light always resides within His holy temple and upon all who present themselves in the house of the Lord. His light in you is enhanced with your acts of kindness, patience, forgiveness, and charity and shows itself in your happy countenance. On the other hand, we walk in shadows when we are too quick to anger or too slow to forgive. \u201cAs you keep your face towards the sunshine, the shadows cannot help but fall behind you.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note19\"><sup class=\"marker\">19<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146040274\" id=\"p21\">As you live to merit the companionship of the Holy Ghost, you truly \u201cincrease your spiritual capacity to receive revelation.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note20\"><sup class=\"marker\">20<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146040276\" id=\"p22\">Life presents challenges and setbacks, and we all must face some dark days and storms. Through it all, if we \u201clet God prevail in our lives,\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note21\"><sup class=\"marker\">21<\/sup><\/a> the light of the Holy Ghost will reveal that there is purpose and meaning in our trials, that they will ultimately transform us into better, more complete individuals with a firmer faith and brighter hope in Christ, knowing that God was there with us in our dark days all along. As President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson has counseled, \u201cThe increasing darkness that accompanies tribulation makes the light of Jesus Christ shine ever brighter.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note22\"><sup class=\"marker\">22<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146040278\" id=\"p23\">Seasons of our lives can take us to places both unexpected and undesirable. If sin has led you there, pull back the curtain of darkness and begin now to humbly approach your Heavenly Father with a broken heart and a contrite spirit and repent. He will hear your earnest prayer. With courage today, \u201cdraw near unto [Him] and [He] will draw near unto you.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note23\"><sup class=\"marker\">23<\/sup><\/a> You are never beyond the healing power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146040279\" id=\"p24\">I come from goodly parents and from faithful ancestors who responded to the light of Jesus Christ and His gospel, and it blessed their lives and the generations that have followed with spiritual resilience. My dad often talked about his father, Milo&nbsp;T Dyches, and shared how his faith in God was a light to him day and night. Grandpa was a forest ranger and often rode alone in the mountains, entrusting his life without question to God\u2019s direction and care.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146040281\" id=\"p25\">Late one fall, Grandpa was alone in the high mountains. Winter had already shown its face when he saddled one of his favorite horses, old Prince, and rode to a sawmill to scale and measure logs before they could be sawed into lumber.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146040283\" id=\"p26\">At dusk, he finished his work and climbed back into the saddle. By then, the temperature had plummeted, and a fierce winter snowstorm was engulfing the mountain. With neither light nor path to guide him, he turned Prince in a direction he thought would lead them back to the ranger station.<\/p>\n<img id=\"img3\" src=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/08/db/08db588aa7cdaa0e0c8799c2ef0dd4bf1e88c49c/forest_ranger_riding_horse_snow.png\" data-img-id=\"576cf4ea0ed80888aebea76c03927e9b6da77692\" srcset=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/ba/9f/ba9f968bcc950f6d0f9464d8317b9e28efbfda06/forest_ranger_riding_horse_snow.png 60w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/fc/c4/fcc42062688db5ee2e5465b37d5f1cff8677bff6/forest_ranger_riding_horse_snow.png 100w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/6f/7f/6f7f0ea5e4320de37d983cee3521c9d5e8ae0c65/forest_ranger_riding_horse_snow.png 200w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/a6/6d/a66d94e592fc716741525f0e64117f3bfc498ca1/forest_ranger_riding_horse_snow.png 250w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/12/15/12159f50ba6220d709d7ced8b9b6c397f6c6ce9c/forest_ranger_riding_horse_snow.png 320w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/08/db/08db588aa7cdaa0e0c8799c2ef0dd4bf1e88c49c/forest_ranger_riding_horse_snow.png 500w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/17/db/17db3e50799af7ed729154fe4e89f90e23fd254f/forest_ranger_riding_horse_snow.png 640w\" data-assetid=\"576cf4ea0ed80888aebea76c03927e9b6da77692\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" alt=\"Forest Ranger\">\n<p data-aid=\"146040285\" id=\"p27\">After traveling miles in the dark, Prince slowed, then stopped. Grandpa repeatedly urged Prince forward, but the horse refused. With blinding snow swirling around them, Grandpa realized he needed God\u2019s help. As he had done throughout his life, he humbly \u201cask[ed] in faith, nothing wavering.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note24\"><sup class=\"marker\">24<\/sup><\/a> A still, small voice answered, \u201cMilo, give Prince his head.\u201d Grandpa obeyed, and as he lightened his hold on the reins, Prince swung around and plodded off in a different direction. Hours later, Prince again halted and lowered his head. Through the driving snow, Grandpa saw that they had safely arrived at the gate of the ranger station.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146040287\" id=\"p28\">With the morning sun, Grandpa retraced the faint tracks of Prince in the snow. He drew a deep breath when he found where he had given Prince his head: it was the very brink of a lofty mountain cliff, where a single step forward would have plunged both horse and rider to their deaths in the rugged rocks below.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146040289\" id=\"p29\">Based on that experience and many others, Grandpa counseled, \u201cThe best and greatest partner you will ever have is your Father in Heaven.\u201d When my dad would relate Grandpa\u2019s story, I remember that he would quote from the scriptures:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146040290\" id=\"p33\">\u201cTrust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not unto thine own understanding.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146040291\" id=\"p34\">\u201cIn all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note25\"><sup class=\"marker\">25<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<img id=\"img2\" src=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/d7/62/d7627e7d35ee85932d89ed56438066e4e02d6d63/jesus_christ_lead_kindly_light_dewey.png\" data-img-id=\"81046f608f0ce03a16a810ef5656ffb2d700bb0d\" srcset=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/17/7c/177cec030df3b28b5e7fef9698888533e5adeeb6/jesus_christ_lead_kindly_light_dewey.png 60w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/1e/b8/1eb8040900b85a0e87dcf0d276cedadd195d69ff/jesus_christ_lead_kindly_light_dewey.png 100w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/13/39/13390c33fa5a50420952da522970960d6c077c32/jesus_christ_lead_kindly_light_dewey.png 200w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/19/29/192965e0c922b3bb78b3c55a0701b6761c71a1c7/jesus_christ_lead_kindly_light_dewey.png 250w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/76/4a/764a40a4a60295c74a83f6796f8f49c69a367f82/jesus_christ_lead_kindly_light_dewey.png 320w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/d7/62/d7627e7d35ee85932d89ed56438066e4e02d6d63/jesus_christ_lead_kindly_light_dewey.png 500w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/d3/42/d342fa46e5d0d5bd2978b6b62b2845ca6861a58b/jesus_christ_lead_kindly_light_dewey.png 640w\" data-assetid=\"81046f608f0ce03a16a810ef5656ffb2d700bb0d\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" alt=\"Lead, Kindly Light\">\n<p data-aid=\"146040292\" id=\"p30\">I testify that Jesus Christ is the everlasting light that \u201cshineth in darkness.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note26\"><sup class=\"marker\">26<\/sup><\/a> There is no darkness that can ever suppress, extinguish, overpower, or defeat that light.
