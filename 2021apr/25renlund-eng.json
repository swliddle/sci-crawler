Renlund<\/p>\n<p class=\"author-role\" data-aid=\"146039053\" id=\"author2\">Of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"kicker\" data-aid=\"146039058\" id=\"kicker1\">Jesus Christ both understands unfairness and has the power to provide a remedy.<\/p>\n<\/header>\n<div class=\"body-block\">\n<p data-aid=\"146039062\" id=\"p1\">In 1994, a genocide took place in the East African country of Rwanda that was partly due to deep-seated tribal tensions. Estimates are that more than half a million people were killed.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\">1<\/sup><\/a> Remarkably, the Rwandan people have in large part reconciled,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\">2<\/sup><\/a> but these events continue to reverberate. <\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039067\" id=\"p2\">A decade ago, while visiting Rwanda, my wife and I struck up a conversation with another passenger at the Kigali airport. He lamented the unfairness of the genocide and poignantly asked, \u201cIf there were a God, wouldn\u2019t He have done something about it?\u201d For this man\u2014and for many of us\u2014suffering and brutal unfairness can seem incompatible with the reality of a kind, loving Heavenly Father. Yet He is real, He is kind, and He loves each of His children perfectly. This dichotomy is as old as mankind and cannot be explained in a simple sound bite or on a bumper sticker.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039072\" id=\"p3\">To begin to make some sense of it, let us explore various types of unfairness. Consider a family in which each child received a weekly monetary allowance for doing common household chores. One son, John, purchased candy; one daughter, Anna, saved her money. Eventually, Anna bought herself a bicycle. John thought it was totally unfair that Anna got a bike when he did not. But John\u2019s choices created the inequality, not parental actions. Anna\u2019s decision to forgo the immediate gratification of eating candy did not impose any unfairness on John, because he had the same opportunity as his sister. <\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039075\" id=\"p4\">Our decisions can likewise yield long-term advantages or disadvantages. As the Lord revealed, \u201cIf a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life <em>through his diligence and obedience<\/em> than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\">3<\/sup><\/a> When others receive benefits because of their diligent choices, we cannot rightly conclude that we have been treated unfairly when we have had the same opportunity. <\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039083\" id=\"p5\">Another example of unfairness stems from a situation my wife, Ruth, encountered as a child. One day Ruth learned that her mother was taking a younger sister, Merla, to buy new shoes. Ruth complained, \u201cMom, it\u2019s so unfair! Merla got the last new pair of shoes.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039087\" id=\"p22\">Ruth\u2019s mother asked, \u201cRuth, do your shoes fit?\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039092\" id=\"p23\">Ruth replied, \u201cWell, yes.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039098\" id=\"p24\">Ruth\u2019s mother then said, \u201cMerla\u2019s shoes no longer fit.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039103\" id=\"p25\">Ruth agreed that every child in the family should have shoes that fit. Although Ruth would have liked new shoes, her perception of being treated unfairly dissipated when she saw the circumstances through her mother\u2019s eyes. <\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039108\" id=\"p6\">Some unfairness cannot be explained; inexplicable unfairness is infuriating. Unfairness comes from living with bodies that are imperfect, injured, or diseased. Mortal life is inherently unfair. Some people are born in affluence; others are not. Some have loving parents; others do not. Some live many years; others, few. And on and on and on. Some individuals make injurious mistakes even when they are trying to do good. Some choose not to alleviate unfairness when they could. Distressingly, some individuals use their God-given agency to hurt others when they never should. <\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039115\" id=\"p7\">Different types of unfairness can merge, creating a tsunami of overwhelming unfairness. For instance, the COVID-19 pandemic disproportionately affects those who already are subject to multifactorial, underlying disadvantages. My heart aches for those who face such unfairness, but I declare with all my aching heart that Jesus Christ both understands unfairness and has the power to provide a remedy. Nothing compares to the unfairness He endured. It was not fair that He experienced all the pains and afflictions of mankind. It was not fair that He suffered for my sins and mistakes and for yours. But He chose to do so because of His love for us and for Heavenly Father. He understands perfectly what we are experiencing.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\">4<\/sup><\/a> <\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039122\" id=\"p8\">Scripture records that ancient Israelites complained that God was treating them unfairly. In response, Jehovah asked, \u201cFor can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb?\u201d As unlikely as it is that a loving mother would forget her infant child, Jehovah declared that His devotion was even more steadfast. He affirmed: \u201cYea, they may forget, yet will I not forget thee. \u2026 Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy walls are continually before me.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\">5<\/sup><\/a> Because Jesus Christ endured the infinite atoning sacrifice, He empathizes perfectly with us.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\">6<\/sup><\/a> He is always aware of us and our circumstances. <\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039130\" id=\"p9\">In mortality, we can \u201ccome boldly\u201d to the Savior and receive compassion, healing, and help.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\">7<\/sup><\/a> Even while we suffer inexplicably, God can bless us in simple, ordinary, and significant ways. As we learn to recognize these blessings, our trust in God will increase. In the eternities, Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ will resolve all unfairness. We understandably want to know <em>how<\/em> and <em>when<\/em>. <em>How<\/em> are They going to do that? <em>When<\/em> are They going to do it? To my knowledge, They have not revealed <em>how<\/em> or <em>when<\/em>.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\">8<\/sup><\/a> What I do know is that They <em>will<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039137\" id=\"p10\">In unfair situations, one of our tasks is to trust that \u201call that is unfair about life can be made right through the Atonement of Jesus Christ.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\">9<\/sup><\/a> Jesus Christ overcame the world and \u201cabsorbed\u201d all unfairness. Because of Him, we can have peace in this world and be of good cheer.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\">10<\/sup><\/a> If we let Him, Jesus Christ will consecrate the unfairness for our gain.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\">11<\/sup><\/a> He will not just console us and restore what was lost;<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\">12<\/sup><\/a> He will use the unfairness for our benefit. When it comes to <em>how<\/em> and <em>when<\/em>, we need to recognize and accept, as did Alma, that \u201cit mattereth not; for God knoweth all these things; and it sufficeth me to know that this is the case.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\">13<\/sup><\/a> <\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039145\" id=\"p11\">We can try to hold our questions about <em>how<\/em> and <em>when<\/em> for later and focus on developing faith in Jesus Christ, that He has both the power to make everything right and yearns to do so.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note14\"><sup class=\"marker\">14<\/sup><\/a> For us to insist on knowing <em>how<\/em> or <em>when<\/em> is unproductive and, after all, myopic.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note15\"><sup class=\"marker\">15<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039151\" id=\"p12\">As we develop faith in Jesus Christ, we should also strive to become like Him. We then approach others with compassion and try to alleviate unfairness where we find it;<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note16\"><sup class=\"marker\">16<\/sup><\/a> we can try to make things right within our sphere of influence. Indeed, the Savior directed that we \u201cshould be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of [our] own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note17\"><sup class=\"marker\">17<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039157\" id=\"p13\">Someone who has been anxiously engaged in combating unfairness is attorney Bryan Stevenson. His legal practice in the United States is dedicated to defending the wrongly accused, ending excessive punishment, and protecting basic human rights. Some years ago, Mr. Stevenson defended a man who had been falsely accused of murder and was condemned to die. Mr. Stevenson asked the man\u2019s local Christian church for support, even though the man was not active in his church and was disparaged in the community due to a widely known extramarital affair. <\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039163\" id=\"p14\">To focus the congregation on what really mattered, Mr. Stevenson spoke to them about the woman accused of adultery who was brought to Jesus. The accusers wanted to stone her to death, but Jesus said, \u201cHe that is without sin&nbsp;\u2026&nbsp;, let him first cast a stone at her.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note18\"><sup class=\"marker\">18<\/sup><\/a> The woman\u2019s accusers withdrew. Jesus did not condemn the woman but charged her to sin no more.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note19\"><sup class=\"marker\">19<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039170\" id=\"p21\">After recounting this episode, Mr. Stevenson observed that self-righteousness, fear, and anger have caused even Christians to hurl stones at people who stumble. He then said, \u201cWe can\u2019t simply watch that happen,\u201d and he encouraged the congregants to become \u201cstonecatchers.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note20\"><sup class=\"marker\">20<\/sup><\/a> Brothers and sisters, not throwing stones is the first step in treating others with compassion. The second step is to try to catch stones thrown by others. <\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039176\" id=\"p15\">How we deal with advantages and disadvantages is part of life\u2019s test. We will be judged not so much by what we say but by how we treat the vulnerable and disadvantaged.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note21\"><sup class=\"marker\">21<\/sup><\/a> As Latter-day Saints, we seek to follow the Savior\u2019s example, to go about doing good.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note22\"><sup class=\"marker\">22<\/sup><\/a> We demonstrate our love for our neighbor by working to ensure the dignity of all Heavenly Father\u2019s children. <\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039183\" id=\"p16\">With our own advantages and disadvantages in mind, reflection is healthy. For John to understand why Anna got the bike was revealing. For Ruth to view Merla\u2019s need for shoes through her mother\u2019s eyes was enlightening. To try to see things with an eternal perspective can be clarifying. As we become more like the Savior, we develop more empathy, understanding, and charity. <\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039192\" id=\"p17\">I return to the question posed by our fellow passenger in Kigali when he lamented the unfairness of the Rwandan genocide and asked, \u201cIf there were a God, wouldn\u2019t He have done something about it?\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039199\" id=\"p26\">Without minimizing the suffering caused by the genocide, and after acknowledging our inability to comprehend such suffering, we replied that Jesus Christ has done something about infuriating unfairness.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note23\"><sup class=\"marker\">23<\/sup><\/a> We explained many gospel precepts concerning Jesus Christ and the Restoration of His Church.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note24\"><sup class=\"marker\">24<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039206\" id=\"p27\">Afterward, our acquaintance asked, with tears in his eyes, \u201cYou mean there is something I can do for my dead parents and uncle?\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039214\" id=\"p28\">We said, \u201cOh, yes!\u201d We then testified that all that is unfair about life can be made right through the Atonement of Jesus Christ and that by His authority families can be joined together forever. <\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039221\" id=\"p18\">When faced with unfairness, we can push ourselves away from God or we can be drawn toward Him for help and support. For example, the prolonged warfare between the Nephites and the Lamanites affected people differently. Mormon observed that \u201cmany had become hardened\u201d while others \u201cwere softened because of their afflictions, insomuch that they did humble themselves before God.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note25\"><sup class=\"marker\">25<\/sup><\/a> <\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039229\" id=\"p19\">Do not let unfairness harden you or corrode your faith in God. Instead, ask God for help. Increase your appreciation for and reliance on the Savior. Rather than becoming bitter, let Him help you become better.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note26\"><sup class=\"marker\">26<\/sup><\/a> Allow Him to help you persevere, to let your afflictions be \u201cswallowed up in the joy of Christ.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note27\"><sup class=\"marker\">27<\/sup><\/a> Join Him in His mission \u201cto heal the brokenhearted,\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note28\"><sup class=\"marker\">28<\/sup><\/a> strive to mitigate unfairness, and become a stonecatcher.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note29\"><sup class=\"marker\">29<\/sup><\/a> <\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039235\" id=\"p20\">I testify that the Savior lives. He understands unfairness. The marks in the palms of His hands continually remind Him of you and your circumstances. He ministers to you in all your distress. For those who come unto Him, a crown of beauty will replace the ashes of mourning; joy and gladness will replace grief and sorrow; appreciation and celebration will replace discouragement and despair.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note30\"><sup class=\"marker\">30<\/sup><\/a> Your faith in Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ will be rewarded more than you can imagine. All unfairness\u2014especially infuriating unfairness\u2014will be consecrated for your gain. I so testify in the name of Jesus Christ, amen. <\/p>\n<\/div>",
