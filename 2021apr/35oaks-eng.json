He has done everything that is essential for our journey through mortality toward the destiny outlined in the plan of our Heavenly Father. I will speak of four of the principal features of that plan. In each of these, His Only Begotten Son, Jesus Christ, is the central figure. Motivating all of this is \u201cthe love of God, which sheddeth itself abroad in the hearts of the children of men; wherefore, it is the most desirable above all things\u201d (<a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/bofm/1-ne/11.22?lang=eng#p22\">1&nbsp;Nephi 11:22<\/a>).<\/p>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"146039175\" id=\"title2\">I.<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"146039181\" id=\"p3\">Just before Easter Sunday, it is timely to speak first of the Resurrection of Jesus Christ. The Resurrection from the dead is the reassuring personal pillar of our faith. It adds meaning to our doctrine, motivation to our behavior, and hope for our future.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039187\" id=\"p4\">Because we believe the Bible and Book of Mormon descriptions of the literal Resurrection of Jesus Christ, we also accept the numerous scriptural teachings that a similar resurrection will come to all mortals who have ever lived upon this earth.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\">1<\/sup><\/a> As Jesus taught, \u201cBecause I live, ye shall live also\u201d (<a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/nt/john/14.19?lang=eng#p19\">John 14:19<\/a>). And His Apostle taught that \u201cthe dead shall be raised incorruptible\u201d and \u201cthis mortal shall have put on immortality\u201d (<a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/nt/1-cor/15.52,54?lang=eng#p52\">1&nbsp;Corinthians 15:52, 54<\/a>).<\/p>\n<img id=\"img2\" src=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/53/ae/53ae9f75a458892ff2bb557b402588a84796bdd6/jesus_christ_leaving_the_tomb.png\" data-img-id=\"83a6629217d81c2cc4aac57e1d569d1d01f2ca03\" srcset=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/ac/b0/acb02f0c1baac69c2f3d6c0d68b5550a631428bb/jesus_christ_leaving_the_tomb.png 60w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/82/d9/82d9c2ae709bad0cc5437a654b05c532688a6b0b/jesus_christ_leaving_the_tomb.png 100w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/78/55/78557701e17d2cd3589f8a04816ef9a221416a41/jesus_christ_leaving_the_tomb.png 200w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/e5/ca/e5ca3ff49b6ada341543a75d54e345f2e031939d/jesus_christ_leaving_the_tomb.png 250w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/75/04/7504a183c530f243228b66a84362881a54459ed2/jesus_christ_leaving_the_tomb.png 320w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/53/ae/53ae9f75a458892ff2bb557b402588a84796bdd6/jesus_christ_leaving_the_tomb.png 500w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/44/df/44df1cea8d30eec1715453d21061a07ae0adb103/jesus_christ_leaving_the_tomb.png 640w\" data-assetid=\"83a6629217d81c2cc4aac57e1d569d1d01f2ca03\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" alt=\"He Lives\">\n<p data-aid=\"146039195\" id=\"p5\">But the Resurrection gives us more than this assurance of immortality. It changes the way we view mortal life.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039202\" id=\"p6\">The Resurrection gives us the perspective and the strength to endure the mortal challenges faced by each of us and those we love. It gives us a new way to view the physical, mental, or emotional deficiencies we have at birth or acquire during mortal life. It gives us the strength to endure sorrows, failures, and frustrations. Because each of us has an assured resurrection, we know that these mortal deficiencies and oppositions are only temporary.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039209\" id=\"p7\">The Resurrection also gives us a powerful incentive to keep the commandments of God during our mortal lives. When we rise from the dead and proceed to our prophesied Final Judgment, we want to have qualified for the choicest blessings promised to resurrected beings.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\">2<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<img id=\"img3\" src=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/16/7d/167d20c1333550d42eb6299c0cbf08955d7c654a/three_generation_family_portrait.png\" data-img-id=\"e6ed1379f7c91ab23877cae2ff3d2d2f62008a21\" srcset=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/4d/e8/4de819e7f01abbbdf749472ec78a9935d25563f3/three_generation_family_portrait.png 60w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/92/be/92be0e3afb68f2d03c6e34ff09db58a2e9136e3b/three_generation_family_portrait.png 100w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/1e/04/1e040967947b1559ba947c995a90036294b7af62/three_generation_family_portrait.png 200w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/11/c0/11c07ab8da2fa52dadb594dfb103a9198c68dd0e/three_generation_family_portrait.png 250w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/62/91/62919308373007530dc777b6b67f3b6b351b1de3/three_generation_family_portrait.png 320w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/16/7d/167d20c1333550d42eb6299c0cbf08955d7c654a/three_generation_family_portrait.png 500w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/50/7b/507b8da02dfb1c46330778f89818cc42c02d60ef/three_generation_family_portrait.png 640w\" data-assetid=\"e6ed1379f7c91ab23877cae2ff3d2d2f62008a21\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" alt=\"Family Portrait\">\n<p data-aid=\"146039216\" id=\"p8\">In addition, the promise that the Resurrection can include an opportunity to be with our family members\u2014husband, wife, children, parents, and posterity\u2014is a powerful encouragement to fulfill our family responsibilities in mortality. It also helps us live together in love in this life, and it comforts us in the death of our loved ones. We know that these mortal separations are only temporary, and we anticipate future joyful reunions and associations. The Resurrection provides us hope and the strength to be patient as we wait. It also prepares us with the courage and dignity to face our own death\u2014even a death that might be called premature.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039223\" id=\"p9\">All of these effects of the Resurrection are part of the first answer to the question \u201cWhat has Jesus Christ done for me?\u201d<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"146039230\" id=\"title3\">II.<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"146039236\" id=\"p10\">For most of us, the opportunity to be forgiven of our sins is the major meaning of the Atonement of Jesus Christ.

This atoning sacrifice offered the ultimate good, the pure lamb without blemish, for the ultimate measure of evil, the sins of the entire world. It opened the door for each of us to be cleansed of our personal sins so we can be readmitted to the presence of God, our Eternal Father. This open door is available to all of the children of God.

In the Bible, Jesus Christ explained this in terms of our Heavenly Father\u2019s love: \u201cFor God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life\u201d (<a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/nt/john/3.16?lang=eng#p16\">John 3:16<\/a>). In modern revelation, our Redeemer, Jesus Christ, declared that <em>He<\/em> \u201cso loved the world that he gave his own life, that as many as would believe might become the sons of God\u201d (<a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/34.3?lang=eng#p3\">Doctrine and Covenants 34:3<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039279\" id=\"p22\">Is it any wonder, then, that the Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ concludes with the teaching that to become \u201cperfect\u201d and \u201csanctified in Christ,\u201d <em>we<\/em> must \u201clove God with all [our] might, mind and strength\u201d?

Through the teachings of His prophets and through His personal ministry, Jesus taught us the plan of salvation. This plan includes the Creation, the purpose of life, the necessity of opposition, and the gift of agency. He also taught us the commandments and covenants we must obey and the ordinances we must experience to take us back to our heavenly parents.<\/p>\n<img id=\"img4\" src=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/b5/19/b519a2eb9b9ae174aaab3fabf643189709964ccf/christ_sermon_mount_lds_anderson.png\" data-img-id=\"d1d40c0c8d5c690bd1d18a027e33cfbb8031eeff\" srcset=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/45/11/4511dd0ec6bee9aff395a94e34be63bf5d6a2b8c/christ_sermon_mount_lds_anderson.png 60w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/d0/9f/d09f0d331519e76770d7c2b4f93fb5f59a6931c8/christ_sermon_mount_lds_anderson.png 100w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/ad/43/ad435287e6a2c12c419276185a7207c89086d117/christ_sermon_mount_lds_anderson.png 200w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/9b/06/9b066a860e782a342fa4c53c37f8cdea734f88ae/christ_sermon_mount_lds_anderson.png 250w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/3b/db/3bdb83ea276398e7cccb9cec966bf9578b0f929d/christ_sermon_mount_lds_anderson.png 320w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/b5/19/b519a2eb9b9ae174aaab3fabf643189709964ccf/christ_sermon_mount_lds_anderson.png 500w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/d9/ec/d9ec4b4c63c3ae1f03c3ea4e1a1760fe7e32c5dc/christ_sermon_mount_lds_anderson.png 640w\" data-assetid=\"d1d40c0c8d5c690bd1d18a027e33cfbb8031eeff\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" alt=\"The Sermon on the Mount\">\n<p data-aid=\"146039289\" id=\"p24\">In the Bible, we read His teaching: \u201cI am the light of the world: he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life\u201d (<a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/nt/john/8.12?lang=eng#p12\">John 8:12<\/a>).

Other scriptures affirm this.

As part of the Father\u2019s plan, the Resurrection of Jesus Christ overcame death to assure each of us immortality. Jesus Christ\u2019s atoning sacrifice gives each of us the opportunity to repent of our sins and return clean to our heavenly home. His commandments and covenants show us the way, and His priesthood gives the authority to perform the ordinances that are essential to reach that destiny.
