How can such a person serve with such love and gratitude, especially considering his great sufferings? What motivated Paul to serve? \u201cI press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\">1<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039882\" id=\"p2\">To press toward the mark is to faithfully continue on the \u201cstrait and narrow path which leads to eternal life\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\">2<\/sup><\/a> with our Savior and our Father in Heaven. Paul viewed his sufferings as \u201cnot worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\">3<\/sup><\/a> Paul\u2019s letter to the Philippians, which he wrote when he was bound in prison, is a letter of overwhelming joy and rejoicing and encouragement to all of us, particularly in this difficult time of uncertainty. We all need to take courage from Paul: \u201cI count all things but loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but dung, that I may win Christ.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\">4<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039892\" id=\"p3\">While we look at Paul\u2019s service, we are inspired and uplifted by our own \u201cPauls\u201d in our day, who also serve, teach, and testify with love and gratitude amidst the challenges they face in their lives and in the lives of their loved ones. An experience I had nine years ago helped me to realize the importance of pressing toward the mark.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039902\" id=\"p4\">In 2012, as I walked for the first time into the general conference leadership meeting, I could not help feeling overwhelmed and inadequate. In my mind there was a voice persistently repeating, \u201cYou do not belong here! A serious mistake had been made!\u201d Just as I was walking trying to find a place to sit, Elder Jeffrey&nbsp;R. Holland spotted me. He came to me and said, \u201cEdward, it is good to see you here,\u201d and he tenderly patted my face. I felt like a baby! His love and embrace warmed me up and helped me to feel the spirit of belonging, the spirit of brotherhood. On the following day, I observed Elder Holland doing the same thing he had done to me on the previous day, warmly patting then-Elder Dallin&nbsp;H. Oaks\u2019s face, who is his senior!<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039912\" id=\"p5\">At that moment I felt the Lord\u2019s love through these men we sustain as prophets, seers, and revelators. Elder Holland, through his kind, natural actions, helped me to overcome my self-centeredness and my feelings of inadequacy. He helped me to focus on the sacred and joyful work to which I had been called\u2014to bring souls to Christ. He, like Paul of old, pointed me to press toward the mark.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039921\" id=\"p6\">Interestingly, Paul is exhorting us to press forward while calling us to forget that which is behind\u2014our past fears, our past focus, our past failures, and our past sadness. He is inviting us, just like our dear prophet, President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson, to \u201ca newer, holier approach.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\">5<\/sup><\/a> The Savior\u2019s promise is real: \u201cFor whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\">6<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039932\" id=\"p7\">In my first general conference address, I shared an experience of my mother teaching me to work in our field. \u201cNever look back,\u201d she said. \u201cLook ahead at what we still have to do.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\">7<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039946\" id=\"p8\">Toward the end of her life, while Mother battled cancer, she lived with Naume and me. One night I heard her sobbing in her bedroom. Her pain was intense, even after taking her last daily dose of morphine only two hours earlier.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039957\" id=\"p9\">I entered her room and sobbed with her. I prayed aloud for her to receive instant relief from her pain. And then she did the same thing she had done in the field years ago: she stopped and taught me a lesson. I will never forget her face at that moment: frail, stricken, and full of pain, gazing with pity on her sorrowing son. She smiled through her tears, looked directly into my eyes, and said, \u201cIt is not up to you or anyone else, but it is up to God whether this pain will go away or not.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039968\" id=\"p10\">I sat up quietly. She too sat quietly. The scene remains vivid in my mind. That night, through my mother, the Lord taught me a lesson that will stay with me forever. As my mother expressed her acceptance of God\u2019s will, I remembered the reason Jesus Christ suffered in the Garden of Gethsemane and on the cross at Golgotha. He said: \u201cBehold I have given unto you my gospel, and this is [my] gospel which I have given unto you\u2014that I came into the world to do the will of my Father, because my Father sent me.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\">8<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<img id=\"img1\" src=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/92/eb/92eb762df52a16c8d97d52d3458f27e35a991017/jesus_praying_in_gethsemane.png\" data-img-id=\"c216055d8e37cdd10528539306d1e8cc05f94896\" srcset=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/a6/08/a608e55517724ce7008940892829726cb960dce9/jesus_praying_in_gethsemane.png 60w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/52/f3/52f331ecbac047f8d672d1ffe97b59c8bc07d5bc/jesus_praying_in_gethsemane.png 100w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/a4/8d/a48ddfaae14892ad13ff265341aea87d80c0c0a3/jesus_praying_in_gethsemane.png 200w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/de/44/de446ce18a6fbe3c8116c41004ceeb895e2c5e44/jesus_praying_in_gethsemane.png 250w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/a7/81/a7812de738cccb7a77d5a5984764726df001a7c7/jesus_praying_in_gethsemane.png 320w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/92/eb/92eb762df52a16c8d97d52d3458f27e35a991017/jesus_praying_in_gethsemane.png 500w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/63/22/63222883caad496ff5838f2102d4210f4b9dec19/jesus_praying_in_gethsemane.png 640w\" data-assetid=\"c216055d8e37cdd10528539306d1e8cc05f94896\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" alt=\"Christ in Gethsemane\">\n<p data-aid=\"146039979\" id=\"p11\">I reflect on our dear prophet President Nelson\u2019s prophetic questions to us in the last general conference. President Nelson asked: \u201cAre <em>you<\/em> willing to let God prevail in your life? Are <em>you<\/em> willing to let God be the most important influence in your life? \u2026 Will you allow His voice to take \u2026 precedence over every other ambition? Are you <em>willing<\/em> to have your will swallowed up in His?\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\">9<\/sup><\/a> My mother would have responded with an emotional but firm \u201cyes,\u201d and other faithful members of the Church across the globe would also respond with an emotional but firm \u201cyes.\u201d President Nelson, thank you for inspiring and uplifting us with these prophetic questions.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146039988\" id=\"p12\">Recently, I had a conversation in Pretoria, South Africa, with a bishop who buried his wife and his adult daughter on the same day. Their lives were claimed by this coronavirus pandemic. I asked how he was doing. Bishop Teddy Thabethe\u2019s response strengthened my resolve to follow the words and counsel from the Lord\u2019s prophets, seers, and revelators. Bishop Thabethe responded that there is always hope and comfort in knowing that the Savior has taken upon Himself the pains of His people that He may know how to succor us.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\">10<\/sup><\/a> With deep faith he testified, \u201cI am grateful for the plan of salvation, the plan of happiness.\u201d He then asked me a question: \u201cIs this not what our prophet was trying to teach us this last conference?\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146040000\" id=\"p13\">While the challenges of mortality will come to all of us in one way or another, let us focus on the goal of our \u201cpress[ing] toward the mark,\u201d which is \u201cthe prize of the high calling of God.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\">11<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146040011\" id=\"p14\">My humble invitation to all of us is to never give up! We are called to \u201clay aside every weight, and the sin which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience the race that is set before us, looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\">12<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146040024\" id=\"p15\">It is not so much about what we are going through in life but what we are becoming. There is joy in pressing toward the mark. I testify that He who overcame all will help us as we look up to Him. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n<\/div>",
