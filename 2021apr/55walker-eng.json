In this hymn we sing:<\/p>\n<div class=\"poetry\">\n<div class=\"stanza\">\n<p class=\"line\" data-aid=\"146040553\" id=\"p2\">Hark, all ye nations! Hear heaven\u2019s voice<\/p>\n<p class=\"line\" data-aid=\"146040554\" id=\"p3\">Thru ev\u2019ry land that all may rejoice!<\/p>\n<p class=\"line\" data-aid=\"146040555\" id=\"p4\">Angels of glory shout the refrain:<\/p>\n<p class=\"line\" data-aid=\"146040556\" id=\"p5\">Truth is restored again!<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\">1<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p data-aid=\"146040557\" id=\"p6\">Louis&nbsp;F. Mönch, the author of this jubilant text, was a German convert who wrote the inspired words for the hymn while living in Switzerland during his full-time missionary service in Europe.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\">2<\/sup><\/a> The joy that springs from witnessing the global impact of the Restoration is clearly articulated in the following words of the hymn:<\/p>\n<div class=\"poetry\">\n<div class=\"stanza\">\n<p class=\"line\" data-aid=\"146040558\" id=\"p7\">Searching in darkness, nations have wept;<\/p>\n<p class=\"line\" data-aid=\"146040559\" id=\"p8\">Watching for dawn, their vigil they\u2019ve kept.<\/p>\n<p class=\"line\" data-aid=\"146040560\" id=\"p9\">All now rejoice; the long night is o\u2019er.<\/p>\n<p class=\"line\" data-aid=\"146040561\" id=\"p10\">Truth is on earth once more!<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\">3<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p data-aid=\"146040562\" id=\"p11\">Thanks to the commencing of the ongoing Restoration just over 200 years ago, \u201cthe gospel light of truth and love\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\">4<\/sup><\/a> now shines brightly throughout the earth. The Prophet Joseph learned in 1820, and millions more have since learned, that God \u201cgiveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\">5<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146040564\" id=\"p12\">Shortly after the organization of the Church in this last dispensation, the Lord spoke to Joseph Smith and manifested His abounding love for us when He said:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146040566\" id=\"p13\">\u201cWherefore, I the Lord, knowing the calamity which should come upon the inhabitants of the earth, called upon my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and spake unto him from heaven, and gave him commandments;&nbsp;\u2026<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146040568\" id=\"p14\">\u201cThat mine everlasting covenant might be established;<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146040571\" id=\"p15\">\u201cThat the fulness of my gospel might be proclaimed by the weak and the simple unto the ends of the world.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\">6<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146040572\" id=\"p16\">Soon after this revelation was received, missionaries began to be called and sent to many nations of the world. Just as the prophet Nephi anticipated, the message of the restored gospel began to be preached \u201camong all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\">7<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146040574\" id=\"p17\">\u201cThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints was formally organized in a small log cabin in upstate New York in 1830.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146040576\" id=\"p18\">\u201cIt took 117 years\u2014until 1947\u2014for the Church to grow from the initial six members to one million. Missionaries were a feature of the Church from its earliest days, fanning out to Native American lands, to Canada and, in 1837, beyond the North American continent to England. Not long after, missionaries were working on the European continent and as far away as India and the Pacific Islands.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146040578\" id=\"p19\">\u201cThe two-million-member mark was reached just 16 years later, in 1963, and the three-million mark in eight years more.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\">8<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146040579\" id=\"p42\">Highlighting the rapid growth of the Church, President Russell&nbsp;M. Nelson recently said: \u201cToday, the Lord\u2019s work in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is moving forward at an accelerated pace. The Church will have an unprecedented, unparalleled future.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\">9<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146040581\" id=\"p20\">The Restoration of the fulness of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the organization of the Lord\u2019s living Church on the earth again, and its remarkable growth since then have made the blessings of the priesthood available throughout the earth. Sacred ordinances and covenants that bind us to God and set us on the covenant path clearly manifest \u201cthe power of godliness.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\">10<\/sup><\/a> As we participate in these sacred ordinances for the living and for the dead, we gather Israel on both sides of the veil and prepare the earth for the Second Coming of the Savior.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146040583\" id=\"p21\">In April 1973, my parents and I traveled from our native Argentina to be sealed in the temple. Since there were no temples in all of Latin America at the time, we flew more than 6,000 miles (9,700 km) each way to be sealed in the Salt Lake Temple. Although I was just two years of age at the time and do not recall the entirety of that special experience, three very distinct images from that trip were fixed in my mind and have remained ever since.<\/p>\n<img id=\"img1\" src=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/56/1e/561ea173feac25041d2bdfb984610a79bbdc94ba/man_flying_window_seat.png\" data-img-id=\"b288181b000c86dd319172b1c0ef0fef7d5bf41b\" srcset=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/2c/c4/2cc4babc0a0c00e6e7198931af65141c463bfc52/man_flying_window_seat.png 60w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/81/b6/81b6b4f39b436cbcef3bb9f269012a4be8cb9f3c/man_flying_window_seat.png 100w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/03/6e/036e6bf84264b3e0a81bb2a3f738cdb81d7e8c67/man_flying_window_seat.png 200w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/08/b3/08b3577b672a3ae029809d746be66bfe332772a8/man_flying_window_seat.png 250w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/d8/48/d8486137c7ec4cb3406d505c595cc64f7732a75b/man_flying_window_seat.png 320w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/56/1e/561ea173feac25041d2bdfb984610a79bbdc94ba/man_flying_window_seat.png 500w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/4a/54/4a54f77d9259e47a22cac5a1bf5f0536824d0056/man_flying_window_seat.png 640w\" data-assetid=\"b288181b000c86dd319172b1c0ef0fef7d5bf41b\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" alt=\"Flight\">\n<p data-aid=\"146040585\" id=\"p22\">First, I recall being placed close to the airplane\u2019s window and seeing the white clouds below.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146040587\" id=\"p24\">Those beautiful, bright clouds endure in my mind as if they had been gigantic cotton balls.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146040589\" id=\"p25\">Another image that has remained in my mind is that of a few funny-looking characters at an amusement park in the Los Angeles area.

However, on this occasion, we did not need to travel thousands of miles because the Buenos Aires Argentina Temple had since been built and dedicated, and it was just a short drive from our home.<\/p>\n<img id=\"img3\" src=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/60/1a/601accce8d829184d585ef3258cfb0f337fadd9d/alan_r_walker_family.png\" data-img-id=\"9078b5147e4ced653aff8187803d3d415653511f\" srcset=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/71/46/7146f1bb0c53a08720029e38f4505206158fd476/alan_r_walker_family.png 60w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/9f/77/9f770696759b92144f36ded6eafa3357c35ef2cf/alan_r_walker_family.png 100w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/bc/12/bc12cac43c426db9301b5c0a013ac75df36253d3/alan_r_walker_family.png 200w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/16/c4/16c4bdbc7f0fa39f50cd9ee9f7626adb0ce669a2/alan_r_walker_family.png 250w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/a2/33/a23392631adad75e00d79842ed16733c74e34a40/alan_r_walker_family.png 320w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/60/1a/601accce8d829184d585ef3258cfb0f337fadd9d/alan_r_walker_family.png 500w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/89/9f/899f97dd674e4af4b6ed2ab2e99ccac2d477c3d4/alan_r_walker_family.png 640w\" data-assetid=\"9078b5147e4ced653aff8187803d3d415653511f\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" alt=\"Alan R.

How fundamental it is to know that He is our God, that we are His people, and that whatever circumstances surround us, if we are faithful and obey the covenants we have entered into, we can be \u201cencircled about eternally in the arms of his love.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\">12<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146040602\" id=\"p33\">During the women\u2019s session of general conference in October 2019, President Nelson said, \u201cAll our efforts to minister to each other, proclaim the gospel, perfect the Saints, and redeem the dead converge in the holy temple.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\">13<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146040603\" id=\"p34\">Also, during the same general conference, President Nelson taught: \u201cOf course, the crowning jewel of the Restoration is the holy temple.
