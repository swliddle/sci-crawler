I was grateful for her goodness. She was baptized. About a year later, I received a phone call. This wonderful woman in the year since her baptism had been taught by the Holy Ghost. She called, sobbing: \u201cDo you remember \u2026 I told you about an abortion from years before? I felt sorry for what I had done. But [this] past year has changed me. \u2026 My heart has been turned to the Savior. \u2026 I am so pained by the seriousness of my sin that I have no way to restore.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"146040105\" id=\"note12_p2\">I felt the Lord\u2019s immense love for this woman. President Boyd&nbsp;K. Packer said: \u201cRestoring what you cannot restore, healing the wound you cannot heal, fixing that which you broke and you cannot fix is the very purpose of the atonement of Christ. When your desire is firm and you are willing to pay the \u2018uttermost farthing\u2019 [see <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/nt/matt/5.25-26?lang=eng#p25\">Matthew 5:25\u201326<\/a>], the law of restitution is suspended. Your obligation is transferred to the Lord. He will settle your accounts\u201d (\u201c<a class=\"cross-ref\" href=\"/study/general-conference/1995/10/the-brilliant-morning-of-forgiveness?lang=eng\">The Brilliant Morning of Forgiveness<\/a>,\u201d <cite>Ensign<\/cite>, Nov. 1995, 19\u201320). I assured her of the Savior\u2019s love. The Lord not only lifted the sin from her; He strengthened and refined her spirit. (See Neil&nbsp;L.
