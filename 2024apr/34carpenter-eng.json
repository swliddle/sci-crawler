To this day, the idea of biting into a juicy, ripe peach with its tangy flavor makes my mouth water. When fully matured peaches are picked, they last two to four days before they spoil. I have fond memories of joining with my mother and my siblings in our kitchen as we would preserve harvested peaches for the coming winter by sealing them in bottles. If we preserved the peaches correctly, this delicious fruit would last several years, not just two to four days. If properly prepared and heated, the fruit is preserved until the seal is broken.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159161598\" id=\"p2\">Christ directed us to \u201cgo and bring forth fruit, \u2026 that your fruit should remain.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\">1<\/sup><\/a> But He wasn\u2019t speaking about peaches. He was talking about God\u2019s blessings to His children. If we make and keep covenants with God, the blessings associated with our covenants can extend beyond this life and be sealed upon us, or preserved, forever, becoming fruit that remains for all eternity.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159161606\" id=\"p3\">The Holy Ghost, in His divine role as the Holy Spirit of Promise, will seal each ordinance upon those who are faithful to their covenants so that it will be valid after mortality.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\">2<\/sup><\/a> Having the Holy Ghost seal our ordinances is essential if we want to have the promised blessings for all eternity, becoming fruit that remains.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159161611\" id=\"p4\">This is particularly important if we want to be exalted.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\">3<\/sup><\/a> As President Russell M. Nelson has taught, we should \u201cbegin with the end in mind. \u2026 Surely, for each of us, the \u2018end\u2019 we would most like to achieve is to live forever with our families in an exalted state where we will be in the presence of God, our Heavenly Father, and His Son Jesus Christ.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\">4<\/sup><\/a> President Nelson has also said: \u201cCelestial marriage is a pivotal part of preparation for eternal life. It requires one to be married to the right person, in the right place, by the right authority, and to obey that sacred covenant faithfully. Then one may be assured of exaltation in the celestial kingdom of God.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\">5<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159161619\" id=\"p5\">What are the blessings of exaltation? They include dwelling in God\u2019s presence for eternity together as husband and wife, inheriting \u201cthrones, kingdoms, principalities, and powers, \u2026 and a continuation of the seeds forever and ever,\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\">6<\/sup><\/a> receiving all that God the Father has.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\">7<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159161628\" id=\"p6\">The Lord revealed through Joseph Smith:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159161638\" id=\"p26\">\u201cIn the celestial glory there are three heavens or degrees;<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159161644\" id=\"p27\">\u201cAnd in order to obtain the highest, a man must enter into this order of the priesthood [meaning the new and everlasting covenant of marriage];<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159161655\" id=\"p28\">\u201cAnd if he does not, he cannot obtain it.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159161666\" id=\"p29\">\u201cHe may enter into the other, but that is the end of his kingdom; he cannot have an increase.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\">8<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159161677\" id=\"p8\">We learn here that one can be in the celestial kingdom, or dwell in the presence of God, and be single. But to be exalted in the highest degree of the celestial kingdom, one must enter into marriage by the proper authority and then be true to the covenants made in that marriage. As we are faithful to these covenants, the Holy Spirit of Promise can seal our marriage covenant.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\">9<\/sup><\/a> Such sealed blessings become fruit that remains.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159161688\" id=\"p10\">What is required to faithfully keep the new and everlasting covenant of marriage?<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159161699\" id=\"p31\">President Russell M. Nelson has taught there are two types of bonds when we enter into this eternal marriage covenant: a lateral bond between husband and wife, and a vertical bond with God.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\">10<\/sup><\/a> To have the blessings of exaltation sealed upon us and remain after this life, we must be true to both the lateral and the vertical bonds of the covenant.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159161709\" id=\"p12\">To keep the lateral bond with your spouse, God has counseled us to \u201clove [your] wife [or husband] with all [your] heart, and \u2026 cleave unto her [or him] and none else.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\">11<\/sup><\/a> For those who are married, to cleave unto her or him and none else means you counsel together in love, you love and care for each other, you prioritize time with your spouse over outside interests, and you call upon God to help you overcome your weaknesses.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\">12<\/sup><\/a> It also means there is no emotional intimacy or sexual relations of any kind outside of your marriage, including flirting or dating, and there is no pornography, which engenders lust.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\">13<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159161720\" id=\"p14\">To keep the lateral bond in the covenant, each partner must desire to be in the marriage. President Dallin H. Oaks recently taught: \u201cWe also know that He [God] will force no one into a sealing relationship against his or her will. The blessings of a sealed relationship are assured for all who keep their covenants <em>but never by forcing a sealed relationship on another person who is unworthy or unwilling<\/em>.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note14\"><sup class=\"marker\">14<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159161731\" id=\"p15\">What is the vertical bond referred to by President Nelson? The vertical bond is one we make with God.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159161742\" id=\"p16\">To keep the vertical bond with God, we are true to the temple covenants we have made regarding the laws of obedience, sacrifice, the gospel, chastity, and consecration. We also covenant with God to receive our eternal companion and to be a righteous spouse and parent. As we keep the vertical bond, we qualify for the blessings of being part of the family of God through the Abrahamic covenant, including the blessings of posterity, the gospel, and the priesthood.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note15\"><sup class=\"marker\">15<\/sup><\/a> These blessings are also the fruit that remains.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159161753\" id=\"p17\">While we hope that all who enter into the new and everlasting covenant remain true and have the blessings sealed upon them for all eternity, sometimes that ideal seems beyond our reach. Throughout my ministry I have encountered members who make and keep covenants while their spouse does not. There are also those who are single, never having the opportunity to marry in mortality. And there are those who are not faithful in their marriage covenants. What happens to individuals in each of these circumstances?<\/p>\n<ol class=\"decimal\" start=\"1\">\n<li data-marker=\"1.\">\n<p data-aid=\"159161760\" id=\"p30\">If you remain faithful to the covenants you made when you were endowed, you will receive the personal blessings promised to you in the endowment <em>even if your spouse has broken his or her covenants or withdrawn from the marriage<\/em>. If you were sealed and later divorced, and if your sealing is not canceled, the personal blessings of that sealing remain in effect for you if you remain faithful.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note16\"><sup class=\"marker\">16<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159161770\" id=\"p19\">Sometimes, due to feelings of betrayal and very real hurt, a faithful spouse may want to cancel their sealing with their unfaithful spouse to get as far away as possible from them, both on earth and for eternity. If you are concerned that you will somehow be tied to an unrepentant former spouse, remember, <em>you will not<\/em>! God will not require anyone to remain in a sealed relationship throughout eternity against his or her will. Heavenly Father will ensure that we will receive every blessing that our desires and choices allow.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note17\"><sup class=\"marker\">17<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159161780\" id=\"p20\">However, if a cancellation of sealing is desired, agency is respected. Certain procedures can be followed. <em>But this should not be done casually<\/em>! The First Presidency holds the keys to bind on earth and in heaven. Once a sealing cancellation has been granted by the First Presidency, the blessings related to that sealing are no longer in force; they are canceled both laterally and vertically. It is important to understand that to receive the blessings of exaltation, we must demonstrate that we are willing to enter into and faithfully keep this new and everlasting covenant, either in this life or the next.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"2.\">\n<p data-aid=\"159161790\" id=\"p21\">For those who are single members of the Church, please remember that \u201cin the Lord\u2019s own way and time, no blessings will be withheld from His faithful Saints. The Lord will judge and reward each individual according to heartfelt [desires] as well as deed.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note18\"><sup class=\"marker\">18<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"3.\">\n<p data-aid=\"159161799\" id=\"p22\">If you have not remained faithful to temple covenants, is there hope? Yes! The gospel of Jesus Christ is a gospel of hope. That hope comes through Jesus Christ with sincere repentance and obediently following Christ\u2019s teachings. I have seen individuals make grave mistakes, breaking sacred covenants. On a regular basis, I see those who sincerely repent, are forgiven, and return to the covenant path. If you have broken your temple covenants, I urge you to turn to Jesus Christ, counsel with your bishop, repent, and open your soul to the <em>mighty<\/em> healing power available because of the Atonement of Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p data-aid=\"159161808\" id=\"p23\">Brothers and sisters, our loving Heavenly Father has given us covenants so that we may have access to all that He has in store for us. These sacred blessings from God are more delicious than any earthly fruit. They can be preserved for us forever, becoming fruit that remains, as we are faithful to our covenants.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159164817\" id=\"p24\">I testify that God has restored the authority to bind on earth and in heaven. That authority is found in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. It is held by the First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve and is exercised under the direction of President Russell M.

As we taught this couple about the restored Church of Jesus Christ, the woman showed great interest in what we were teaching. Over the next few weeks, she gained a testimony of the reality that the Church of Jesus Christ was restored with correct authority from God and that Jesus Christ directs His Church through living prophets and apostles. We looked forward to teaching this couple about one of the most sublime doctrines of the Restoration, the opportunity for eternal marriage. Surprisingly, however, as we taught this couple about the doctrine of eternal marriage, the Swiss woman remarked that she had no interest in being with her husband for all eternity. To her, heaven did not include being with her husband, to whom she had been married for 36 years. This sister was baptized, but her husband was not. They were never sealed in the temple.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159165008\" id=\"note16_p2\">To many, however, heaven would not be heaven without being with the person to whom they are married. To be together with the spouse you love forever truly sounds like heaven. As Elder Jeffrey R. Holland shared about his dear, beloved wife, Pat, heaven would not be heaven without her (see \u201cScott Taylor: For Elder Holland, Heaven without His Wife and Children \u2018Wouldn\u2019t Be Heaven for Me,\u2019\u201d <cite>Church News<\/cite>, July 22, 2023, thechurchnews.com).<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"17.\" id=\"note17\" data-full-marker=\"17.\">\n<p data-aid=\"159165014\" id=\"note17_p1\">See Dallin H.

As we taught this couple about the restored Church of Jesus Christ, the woman showed great interest in what we were teaching. Over the next few weeks, she gained a testimony of the reality that the Church of Jesus Christ was restored with correct authority from God and that Jesus Christ directs His Church through living prophets and apostles. We looked forward to teaching this couple about one of the most sublime doctrines of the Restoration, the opportunity for eternal marriage. Surprisingly, however, as we taught this couple about the doctrine of eternal marriage, the Swiss woman remarked that she had no interest in being with her husband for all eternity. To her, heaven did not include being with her husband, to whom she had been married for 36 years. This sister was baptized, but her husband was not. They were never sealed in the temple.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159165008\" id=\"note16_p2\">To many, however, heaven would not be heaven without being with the person to whom they are married. To be together with the spouse you love forever truly sounds like heaven. As Elder Jeffrey R. Holland shared about his dear, beloved wife, Pat, heaven would not be heaven without her (see \u201cScott Taylor: For Elder Holland, Heaven without His Wife and Children \u2018Wouldn\u2019t Be Heaven for Me,\u2019\u201d <cite>Church News<\/cite>, July 22, 2023, thechurchnews.com).<\/p>",
