Rasband<\/p>\n<p class=\"author-role\" data-aid=\"159163124\" id=\"author2\">Of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p class=\"kicker\" data-aid=\"159163129\" id=\"kicker1\">Words set a tone. They voice our thoughts, feelings, and experiences, for good or bad.<\/p>\n<\/header>\n<div class=\"body-block\">\n<p data-aid=\"159163133\" id=\"p1\">Brothers, sisters, and friends across the world, I am honored to address this vast audience, many of whom are members of our Church and many of whom are friends and new listeners to this conference broadcast. Welcome!<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159163139\" id=\"p2\">The messages shared from this pulpit are communicated in words. They are given in English and translated into nearly 100 different languages. Always the base is the same. Words. And words matter a lot. Let me say that again. Words matter!<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159163145\" id=\"p3\">They are the bedrock of how we connect; they represent our beliefs, morals, and perspectives. Sometimes we speak words; other times we listen. Words set a tone. They voice our thoughts, feelings, and experiences, for good or bad.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159163151\" id=\"p4\">Unfortunately, words can be thoughtless, hasty, and hurtful. Once said, we cannot take them back. They can wound, punish, cut down, and even lead to destructive actions. They can weigh heavily on us.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159163157\" id=\"p5\">On the other hand, words can celebrate victory, be hopeful and encouraging. They can prompt us to rethink, reboot, and redirect our course. Words can open our minds to truth.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159163164\" id=\"p6\">That is why, first and foremost, the Lord\u2019s words matter.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159163171\" id=\"p7\">In the Book of Mormon, the prophet Alma and his people in ancient America encountered endless warfare with those who had disregarded the word of God, hardened their hearts, and corrupted their culture. The faithful could have fought, but Alma counseled: \u201cAnd now, as the preaching of the word had a great tendency to lead the people to do that which was just\u2014yea, it had had more powerful effect upon the minds of the people than the sword, or anything else, which had happened unto them\u2014therefore Alma thought it was expedient that they should try the virtue of the word of God.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\">1<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159163177\" id=\"p9\">The \u201cword of God\u201d surpasses all other expressions. It has been so since the Creation of the earth when the Lord spoke: \u201cLet there be light: and there was light.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\">2<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159163184\" id=\"p10\">From the Savior came these assurances in the New Testament: \u201cHeaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\">3<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159163190\" id=\"p11\">And this: \u201cIf a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\">4<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159163197\" id=\"p12\">And from Mary, the mother of Jesus, came this humble testimony: \u201cBehold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\">5<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159163202\" id=\"p13\">Believing and heeding the word of God will draw us closer to Him. President Russell M. Nelson has promised, \u201cIf you will study His words, your ability to be more like Him will increase.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\">6<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159163210\" id=\"p14\">Don\u2019t we all want to be, as the hymn says, \u201cmore blessed and holy\u2014more, Savior, like thee\u201d?<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\">7<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159163216\" id=\"p15\">I picture young Joseph Smith on his knees hearing the words of his Father in Heaven: \u201c[Joseph,] This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\">8<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159163223\" id=\"p16\">We \u201chear Him\u201d in the words of scripture, but do we let them just sit on the page, or do we recognize He is speaking to us? Do we change?<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159163229\" id=\"p17\">We \u201chear Him\u201d in personal revelation and promptings from the Holy Ghost, in answers to prayer, and in those moments when only Jesus Christ, through the power of His Atonement, can lift our burdens, grant us forgiveness and peace, and embrace us \u201cin the arms of his love.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\">9<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159163235\" id=\"p18\">Second, the words of prophets matter.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159163242\" id=\"p19\">Prophets testify of the divinity of Jesus Christ.

He said: \u201cThe obligation that we make when we raise our hands \u2026 is a most sacred one. \u2026 It means \u2026 that we will stand behind him; we will pray for him; \u2026 and we will strive to carry out his instructions as the Lord shall direct.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note21\"><sup class=\"marker\">21<\/sup><\/a> In other words, we will diligently act upon our prophet\u2019s words.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159163272\" id=\"p24\">As one of 15 prophets, seers, and revelators sustained yesterday by our worldwide Church, I want to share with you one of my experiences sustaining the prophet and embracing his words.

For months I had contemplated the dedication. What had settled in my soul and mind was that the country and the temple had been cradled in the arms of prophets and apostles. President Thomas S.

Those sacred words had been translated into 12 languages. We were ready. Or so I thought.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159163289\" id=\"p27\">The night before the dedication, I was awakened from my sleep with an unsettled, urgent feeling about the dedicatory prayer. I tried to set aside the prompting, thinking the prayer was in place. But the Spirit would not leave me alone. I sensed certain words were missing, and by divine design they came to me in revelation, and I inserted these words in the prayer near the end: \u201cMay we think celestial, letting Thy Spirit prevail in our lives, and strive to be peacemakers always.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note28\"><sup class=\"marker\">28<\/sup><\/a> The Lord was reminding me to heed the words of our living prophet: \u201cThink celestial,\u201d \u201clet the Spirit prevail,\u201d \u201cstrive to be peacemakers.\u201d Words of the prophet matter to the Lord and to us.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159163297\" id=\"p28\">Third, and so very important, are our own words. Believe me, in our emoji-filled<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note29\"><sup class=\"marker\">29<\/sup><\/a> world, our words matter.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159163302\" id=\"p29\">Our words can be supportive or angry, joyful or mean, compassionate or tossed aside. In the heat of the moment, words can sting and sink painfully deep into the soul\u2014and stay there. Our words on the internet, texting, social media, or tweets take on a life of their own. So be careful what you say and how you say it. In our families, especially with husbands, wives, and children, our words can bring us together or drive a wedge between us.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159163309\" id=\"p30\">Let me suggest three simple phrases that we can use to take the sting out of difficulties and differences, lift, and reassure each other:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159163314\" id=\"p31\">\u201cThank you.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159163320\" id=\"p32\">\u201cI am sorry.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159163325\" id=\"p33\">And \u201cI love you.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159163328\" id=\"p35\">Do not save these humble phrases for a special event or catastrophe. Use them often and sincerely, for they show regard for others. Talk is growing cheap; do not follow that pattern.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159163331\" id=\"p36\">We can say \u201cthank you\u201d on the elevator, in the parking lot, at the market, in the office, in a queue, or with our neighbors or friends. We can say \u201cI am sorry\u201d when we make a mistake, miss a meeting, forget a birthday, or see someone in pain. We can say \u201cI love you,\u201d and those words carry the message \u201cI am thinking about you,\u201d \u201cI care about you,\u201d \u201cI am here for you,\u201d or \u201cYou are everything to me.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159163337\" id=\"p37\">Let me share a personal example. Husbands, take heed. Sisters, this is going to help you too. Before my full-time assignment in the Church, I traveled widely for my company. I was gone a fair amount of time to far reaches of the world. At the end of my day, no matter where I was, I always called home. When my wife, Melanie, picked up the phone and I reported in, our conversation always led us to expressing \u201cI love you.\u201d Every day, those words served as an anchor to my soul and my conduct; they were a protection to me from evil designs. \u201cMelanie, I love you\u201d spoke of the precious trust between us.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159163345\" id=\"p38\">President Thomas S. Monson used to say, \u201cThere are feet to steady, hands to grasp, minds to encourage, hearts to inspire, and souls to save.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note30\"><sup class=\"marker\">30<\/sup><\/a> Saying \u201cthank you,\u201d \u201cI am sorry,\u201d \u201cI love you\u201d will do just that.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159163351\" id=\"p39\">Brothers and sisters, words do matter.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159163357\" id=\"p40\">I promise that if we \u201cfeast upon the words of Christ\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note31\"><sup class=\"marker\">31<\/sup><\/a> that lead to salvation, our prophet\u2019s words that guide and encourage us, and our own words that speak of who we are and what we hold dear, the powers of heaven will pour down upon us. \u201cThe words of Christ will tell you all things what ye should do.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note32\"><sup class=\"marker\">32<\/sup><\/a> We are Heavenly Father\u2019s children and He is our God, and He expects us to speak with \u201cthe tongue of angels\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note33\"><sup class=\"marker\">33<\/sup><\/a> by the power of the Holy Ghost.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note34\"><sup class=\"marker\">34<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159163365\" id=\"p41\">I love the Lord Jesus Christ.
