This could cause us to put in the background the real source of succor and support that can counter the challenges of this mortal life.<\/p>\n<img alt=\"Hospital room. \" id=\"img1\" src=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/e2ba9111f38d11eeb853eeeeac1e4830dc7ab9a5/full/500%2C/0/default\" data-img-id=\"e2ba9111f38d11eeb853eeeeac1e4830dc7ab9a5\" srcset=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/e2ba9111f38d11eeb853eeeeac1e4830dc7ab9a5/full/60%2C/0/default 60w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/e2ba9111f38d11eeb853eeeeac1e4830dc7ab9a5/full/100%2C/0/default 100w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/e2ba9111f38d11eeb853eeeeac1e4830dc7ab9a5/full/200%2C/0/default 200w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/e2ba9111f38d11eeb853eeeeac1e4830dc7ab9a5/full/250%2C/0/default 250w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/e2ba9111f38d11eeb853eeeeac1e4830dc7ab9a5/full/320%2C/0/default 320w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/e2ba9111f38d11eeb853eeeeac1e4830dc7ab9a5/full/500%2C/0/default 500w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/e2ba9111f38d11eeb853eeeeac1e4830dc7ab9a5/full/640%2C/0/default 640w\" data-assetId=\"e2ba9111f38d11eeb853eeeeac1e4830dc7ab9a5\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"481\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.0395010395010396\"/>\n<p data-aid=\"159163481\" id=\"p3\">I remember an occasion when I was hospitalized for an illness, and it was difficult for me to sleep.

When I asked the nurse about it, she said, \u201cIt is to prevent a blow that might increase the pain you already have.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159163496\" id=\"p5\">This life, by its nature, brings painful experiences, some inherent to our physical bodies, some due to our weaknesses or afflictions, some due to the way others use their agency, and some due to our use of agency.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159163504\" id=\"p6\">Is there a promise more powerful than the one the Savior Himself made when He declared, \u201cAsk, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock,\u201d or call, \u201cand it shall be opened unto you\u201d?<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\">1<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159163512\" id=\"p7\">Prayer is the means of communication with our Heavenly Father that allows us to \u201ccall and don\u2019t fall.\u201d However, there are circumstances in which we might think that the call has not been heard because we do not receive an immediate response or one according to our expectations.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159163520\" id=\"p41\">This sometimes leads to anxiety, sadness, or disappointment. But remember Nephi\u2019s expression of faith in the Lord when he said, \u201cHow is it that he cannot instruct me, that I should build a ship?\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\">2<\/sup><\/a> Now, I ask you, how is it that the Lord cannot instruct you, that you do not fall?<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159163528\" id=\"p8\">Confidence in God\u2019s answers implies accepting that His ways are not our ways<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\">3<\/sup><\/a> and that \u201call things must come to pass in their time.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\">4<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159163535\" id=\"p9\">The certainty of knowing that we are children of a loving and merciful Heavenly Father should be the motivation to \u201ccall\u201d in devout prayer with an attitude of \u201cpray[ing] always, and not faint[ing]; \u2026 that [our] performance may be for the welfare of [our] soul[s].\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\">5<\/sup><\/a> Imagine the feelings of Heavenly Father when in each prayer we make a supplication in the name of His Son, Jesus Christ. What power and tenderness, I believe, are displayed when we do so!<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159163545\" id=\"p10\">The scriptures are full of examples of those who called out to God so they would not fall. Helaman and his army, while facing their afflictions, called upon God, pouring out their souls in prayer. They received assurance, peace, faith, and hope, gaining courage and determination until they achieved their goal.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\">6<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159163556\" id=\"p11\">Imagine how Moses would have called and cried out to God when finding himself between the Red Sea and the Egyptians approaching to attack, or Abraham when obeying the mandate to sacrifice his son Isaac.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159163564\" id=\"p12\">I am certain that each of you have had and will have experiences where calling will be the answer to not fall.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159163573\" id=\"p13\">Thirty years ago, while my wife and I were preparing for our civil marriage and our temple marriage, we received a call informing us that civil marriages were canceled due to a strike. We received the call three days before the scheduled ceremony. After several attempts at other offices and not finding available appointments, we began to feel distressed and doubtful that we really could get married as planned.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159163582\" id=\"p14\">My fiancÃ©e and I \u201ccalled,\u201d pouring out our souls to God in prayer. Finally, someone told us about an office in a small town on the outskirts of the city where an acquaintance was the mayor. Without hesitation, we went to visit him and asked him if it would be possible to marry us. To our joy, he agreed. His secretary emphasized to us that we had to obtain a certificate in that city and deliver all the documents before noon the next day.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159163591\" id=\"p15\">The next day, we moved to the small town and went to the police station to request the required document. To our surprise, the officer said that he would not give it to us because many young couples had been running away from their families to get married secretly in that town, which of course was not our case. Again, fear and sadness overtook us.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159163600\" id=\"p16\">I remember how I silently called out to my Heavenly Father so as not to fall. I received a clear impression in my mind, repeatedly saying, \u201cTemple recommend, temple recommend.\u201d I immediately took out my temple recommend and handed it to the officer, to my fiancÃ©e\u2019s bewilderment.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159163609\" id=\"p42\">What a surprise we had when we heard the officer say, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me that you are from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints? I know your church well.\u201d He immediately began to prepare the document. We were even more surprised when the officer left the station without saying anything.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159163617\" id=\"p43\">Fifty minutes passed, and he did not return. It was already 11:55 in the morning, and we had only until noon to deliver the papers. Suddenly he appeared with a beautiful puppy and told us it was a wedding gift and gave it to us along with the document.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159163624\" id=\"p17\">We ran toward the mayor\u2019s office with our document and our new dog. Then we saw an official vehicle coming toward us. I stopped in front of it. The vehicle stopped, and we saw the secretary inside. Seeing us, she said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry; I told you noon. I must go on another errand.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159163633\" id=\"p44\">I humbled myself in silence, calling with all my heart to my Heavenly Father, asking for help once again to \u201cnot fall.\u201d Suddenly, the miracle happened. The secretary said to us, \u201cWhat a beautiful dog you have. Where could I find one like that for my son?\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159163639\" id=\"p18\">\u201cIt is for you,\u201d we immediately replied.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159163647\" id=\"p19\">The secretary looked at us with surprise and said, \u201cOK, let\u2019s go to the office and make the arrangements.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159163655\" id=\"p20\">Two days later, Carol and I were married civilly, as planned, and then we were sealed in the Lima Peru Temple.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159163663\" id=\"p21\">Of course, we need to remember that calling is a matter of faith and action\u2014faith to recognize that we have a Heavenly Father who answers our prayers according to His infinite wisdom, and then action consistent with what we asked for. Praying\u2014calling\u2014can be a sign of our hope. But taking action after praying is a sign that our faith is real\u2014faith that is tested in moments of pain, fear, or disappointment.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159163671\" id=\"p22\">I suggest you consider the following:<\/p>\n<ol class=\"decimal\" start=\"1\">\n<li data-marker=\"1.\">\n<p data-aid=\"159163678\" id=\"p23\">Always think of the Lord as your first option for help.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"2.\">\n<p data-aid=\"159163685\" id=\"p24\">Call, don\u2019t fall. Turn to God in sincere prayer.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"3.\">\n<p data-aid=\"159163692\" id=\"p25\">After praying, do all you can to obtain the blessings you prayed for.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"4.\">\n<p data-aid=\"159163699\" id=\"p26\">Humble yourselves to accept the answer in His time and His way.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"5.\">\n<p data-aid=\"159163706\" id=\"p27\">Don\u2019t stop! Keep moving forward on the covenant path while you wait for an answer.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p data-aid=\"159163713\" id=\"p28\">Perhaps there is someone right now who, due to circumstances, feels like they are about to fall and would like to call like Joseph Smith did when he cried out: \u201cO God, where art thou? \u2026 How long shall thy hand be stayed?\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\">7<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159163720\" id=\"p29\">Even in circumstances such as these, pray with \u201cspiritual momentum,\u201d as President RussellÂ M. Nelson taught,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\">8<\/sup><\/a> because your prayers are always heard!<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159163725\" id=\"p30\">Remember this hymn:<\/p>\n<div class=\"poetry\">\n<div class=\"stanza\">\n<p class=\"line\" data-aid=\"159163731\" id=\"p31\">Ere you left your room this morning,<\/p>\n<p class=\"line\" data-aid=\"159163738\" id=\"p32\">Did you think to pray?<\/p>\n<p class=\"line\" data-aid=\"159163744\" id=\"p33\">In the name of Christ, our Savior,<\/p>\n<p class=\"line\" data-aid=\"159163750\" id=\"p34\">Did you sue for loving favor<\/p>\n<p class=\"line\" data-aid=\"159163756\" id=\"p35\">As a shield today?<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"stanza\">\n<p class=\"line\" data-aid=\"159163762\" id=\"p36\">Oh, how praying rests the weary!<\/p>\n<p class=\"line\" data-aid=\"159163769\" id=\"p37\">Prayer will change the night to day.<\/p>\n<p class=\"line\" data-aid=\"159163778\" id=\"p38\">So, when life gets dark and dreary,<\/p>\n<p class=\"line\" data-aid=\"159163783\" id=\"p39\">Don\u2019t forget to pray.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><i><sup class=\"marker\">9<\/sup><\/i><\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p data-aid=\"159163789\" id=\"p40\">As we pray we can feel the embrace of our Heavenly Father, who sent His Only Begotten Son to relieve our burdens, because if we call out to God, I testify we will not fall.
