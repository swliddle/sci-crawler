During that time, I have been asked questions relating to these messages by many around the world. Lately, one particular question keeps coming up. It usually goes something like this: \u201cElder Uchtdorf, I listened carefully to your last talk, but \u2026 I didn\u2019t hear anything about aviation.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159161609\" id=\"p2\">Well, after today, I might not hear that question for a while.<\/p>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"159161617\" id=\"title2\">On \u201cthe Tumbling Mirth of Sun-Split Clouds\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\">1<\/sup><\/a><\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"159161626\" id=\"p3\">It\u2019s hard to believe it was only 120 years ago when Wilbur and Orville Wright first lifted off and flew over the sands of Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. Four short flights on that December day changed the world and opened the door to one of the greatest inventions in the world\u2019s history.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159161636\" id=\"p4\">Flying was risky in those early days. The brothers knew this. And so did their father, Milton. In fact, he was so terrified of losing both of his sons in a flying accident that they promised him they would never fly together.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159161653\" id=\"p5\">And they never did\u2014with one exception. Seven years after that historic day at Kitty Hawk, Milton Wright finally gave his consent and watched as Wilbur and Orville flew together for the first time. After landing, Orville convinced his father to take his first and only flight and to see for himself what it was like.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159161664\" id=\"p6\">As the plane lifted from the ground, the 82-year-old Milton got so caught up in the exhilaration of flight that all fear left him.

Today, in the spirit of Milton Wright\u2019s delighted cry, \u201cHigher, Orville, higher,\u201d I would like to speak about this higher joy\u2014where it comes from, how it enters our hearts, and how we can experience it in greater measure.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"159161719\" id=\"title3\">The Whole Aim of Human Existence<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"159161730\" id=\"p11\">It probably goes without saying that everyone wants to be happy.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\">4<\/sup><\/a> Nevertheless, it also goes without saying that not everyone is happy. Sadly, it seems that for many people, happiness is hard to find.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\">5<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159161741\" id=\"p12\">Why is that? If happiness is the one thing we humans desire most, why are we so unsuccessful at finding it? To paraphrase a country song, maybe we\u2019ve been looking for joy in all the wrong places.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\">6<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"159161752\" id=\"title4\">Where Can We Find Happiness?<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"159161764\" id=\"p13\">Before we discuss how to find joy, allow me to acknowledge that depression and other difficult mental and emotional challenges are real, and the answer is not simply \u201cTry to be happier.\u201d My purpose today is not to diminish or trivialize mental health issues. If you face such challenges, I mourn with you, and I stand beside you. For some people, finding joy may include seeking help from trained mental health professionals who devote their lives to practicing their very important art. We should be thankful for such help.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159161773\" id=\"p14\">Life is not an endless sequence of emotional highs. \u201cFor it must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\">7<\/sup><\/a> And if God Himself weeps, as the scriptures affirm He does,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\">8<\/sup><\/a> then of course you and I will weep as well. Feeling sad is not a sign of failure. In this life, at least, joy and sorrow are inseparable companions.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\">9<\/sup><\/a> Like all of you, I have felt my share of disappointment, sorrow, sadness, and remorse.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159161783\" id=\"p15\">However, I have also experienced for myself the glorious dawn that fills the soul with joy so profound that it can scarcely be kept in. I have discovered for myself that this peaceful confidence comes from following the Savior and walking in His Way.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159161793\" id=\"p16\">The peace He gives us is not like what the world gives.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\">10<\/sup><\/a> It\u2019s better. It\u2019s higher and holier. Jesus said, \u201cI am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\">11<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159161802\" id=\"p17\">The gospel of Jesus Christ is truly the \u201cgood news of great joy\u201d!<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\">12<\/sup><\/a> It is a message of matchless hope! A message of yoke-bearing and burden-lifting.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\">13<\/sup><\/a> Of light-gathering. Of heavenly favor, higher understanding, holier covenants, eternal security, and everlasting glory!<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159164811\" id=\"p18\">Joy is the very purpose of God\u2019s plan for His children. It\u2019s what you were created for\u2014\u201cthat [you] might have joy\u201d!<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note14\"><sup class=\"marker\">14<\/sup><\/a> You were built for this!<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159164820\" id=\"p19\">Our Father in Heaven has not hidden the path to happiness.

What a remarkable promise!<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"159164842\" id=\"title5\">God Has Something More to Offer<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"159164851\" id=\"p21\">We all know people who say that they don\u2019t need God to be happy, that they are happy enough without religion.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159164860\" id=\"p22\">I acknowledge and respect these feelings. Our beloved Father in Heaven wants all His children to have as much happiness as possible, so He has filled this world with beautiful, wholesome pleasures and delights, \u201cboth to please the eye and \u2026 gladden the heart.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note16\"><sup class=\"marker\">16<\/sup><\/a> For me, flying brought great happiness. Others find it in music, in art, in hobbies, or in nature.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159164869\" id=\"p23\">By inviting everyone and sharing the Savior\u2019s good news of great joy, we do not discount any of these sources of joy. We\u2019re simply saying that God has something more to give. A higher and more profound joy\u2014a joy that transcends anything this world offers. It is a joy that endures heartbreak, penetrates sorrow, and diminishes loneliness.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159164877\" id=\"p24\">Worldly happiness, by contrast, does not last. It cannot. It is the nature of all earthly things to grow old, decay, wear out, or become stale. But godly joy is eternal, because God is eternal. Jesus Christ came to lift us out of the temporal and replace corruption with incorruption. Only He has that power, and only His joy is perpetual.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159164886\" id=\"p25\">If you feel there could be more of this kind of joy in your life, I invite you to embark on the journey of following Jesus Christ and His Way. It is a journey of a lifetime\u2014and beyond. Please let me suggest a few beginning steps on this worthy journey of discovering pure joy.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"159164895\" id=\"title6\">Draw Near unto God<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note17\"><sup class=\"marker\">17<\/sup><\/a><\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"159164904\" id=\"p26\">Do you remember the woman in the New Testament who endured a bleeding illness for 12 years?<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note18\"><sup class=\"marker\">18<\/sup><\/a> She had spent all she had on physicians, but things only grew worse. She had heard of Jesus; His power to heal was well known. But could He heal her? And how could she even get near Him?

She extended her hand.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159164949\" id=\"p31\">And she was healed.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159164958\" id=\"p32\">Aren\u2019t we all somewhat like this woman?<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159164967\" id=\"p33\">There may be many reasons why we hesitate to draw near to the Savior. We may face ridicule or condemnation by others. In our pride, we may dismiss the possibility of something so simple being of so much value. We may think that our condition somehow disqualifies us from His healing\u2014that the distance is too great or our sins too many.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159164976\" id=\"p34\">Like this woman, I have learned that if we draw near to God and reach out to touch Him, we can indeed find healing, peace, and joy.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"159164985\" id=\"title7\">Look for It<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"159164992\" id=\"p35\">Jesus taught, \u201cSeek, and ye shall find.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note21\"><sup class=\"marker\">21<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159164999\" id=\"p36\">I believe this simple phrase is not only a spiritual promise; it is a statement of fact.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159165006\" id=\"p37\">If we seek reasons to be angry, to doubt, to be bitter or alone, we will find them too.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159165013\" id=\"p38\">However, if we seek joy\u2014if we look for reasons to rejoice and to happily follow the Savior, we will find them.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159165020\" id=\"p39\">We rarely find something we are not looking for.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159165027\" id=\"p40\">Are you looking for joy?<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159165034\" id=\"p41\">Seek, and ye shall find.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"159165040\" id=\"title8\">Bear One Another\u2019s Burdens<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note22\"><sup class=\"marker\">22<\/sup><\/a><\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"159165046\" id=\"p42\">Jesus taught, \u201cIt is more blessed to give than to receive.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note23\"><sup class=\"marker\">23<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159165052\" id=\"p43\">Can it be that in our search for joy, the best way to find it is to bring joy to others?<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159165058\" id=\"p44\">Brothers and sisters, you know and I know this is true!
