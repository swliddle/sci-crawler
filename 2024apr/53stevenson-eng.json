However, when possible, I spend a few moments in a particular passion. I have an interest in architecture and design and a special fascination with bridges. Suspension bridges amaze me. Whether it\u2019s the Rainbow Bridge in Tokyo, the Tsing Ma Bridge in Hong Kong, the Tower Bridge in London, or others I have seen, I marvel at the engineering genius built within these complicated structures. Bridges take us places we otherwise would not be able to go. (Before I continue, I note that since this message was prepared, a tragic bridge accident occurred in Baltimore. We mourn the loss of life and offer condolences to affected families.)<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"159161715\" id=\"title3\">A Magnificent Suspension Bridge<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"159161726\" id=\"p3\">\u200bRecently, a conference assignment took me to California, where I once again crossed the iconic Golden Gate Bridge, regarded as an engineering wonder of the world. This monumental structure intertwines beautiful form, functional purpose, and masterful engineering. It is a classic suspension bridge with bookend towers, supported by massive piers. The colossal, majestic weight-bearing twin towers soaring above the ocean were the first elements to be constructed. Together they shoulder the load of the sweeping main suspension cables and the vertical suspender cables, which cradle the roadway below. The extraordinary stabilizing capacity\u2014the power of the tower\u2014is the magic behind the engineering of the bridge.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"image no-print\" id=\"figure1\">\n<img alt=\"Golden Gate Bridge under construction.\" id=\"figure1_img1\" src=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/e16664c7f36311eea1daeeeeac1ec06d5b2b7b5a/full/500%2C/0/default\" data-img-id=\"e16664c7f36311eea1daeeeeac1ec06d5b2b7b5a\" srcset=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/e16664c7f36311eea1daeeeeac1ec06d5b2b7b5a/full/60%2C/0/default 60w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/e16664c7f36311eea1daeeeeac1ec06d5b2b7b5a/full/100%2C/0/default 100w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/e16664c7f36311eea1daeeeeac1ec06d5b2b7b5a/full/200%2C/0/default 200w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/e16664c7f36311eea1daeeeeac1ec06d5b2b7b5a/full/250%2C/0/default 250w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/e16664c7f36311eea1daeeeeac1ec06d5b2b7b5a/full/320%2C/0/default 320w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/e16664c7f36311eea1daeeeeac1ec06d5b2b7b5a/full/500%2C/0/default 500w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/e16664c7f36311eea1daeeeeac1ec06d5b2b7b5a/full/640%2C/0/default 640w\" data-assetId=\"e16664c7f36311eea1daeeeeac1ec06d5b2b7b5a\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"396\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.2626262626262625\"/>\n<div class=\"credit\">\n<p data-aid=\"159161737\" id=\"figure1_p1\">Golden Gate Bridge District<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<p data-aid=\"159161748\" id=\"p5\">Early construction images of the bridge bear testimony of this engineering principle.

As we do so, let the image of the magnificent suspension bridge resonate in your mind\u2019s eye.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"159164844\" id=\"title4\">Love the Lord<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"159164853\" id=\"p13\">The first, to love the Lord with all your heart, soul, and mind.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159164862\" id=\"p14\">In this answer, Jesus Christ condenses the essence of the law embodied in the sacred teachings of the Old Testament. To love the Lord centers first on your heart\u2014your very nature. The Lord asks that you love with all your soul<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\">4<\/sup><\/a>\u2014your entire consecrated being\u2014and finally, to love with all your mind\u2014your intelligence and intellect. Love for God is not limited or finite. It is infinite and eternal.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159164874\" id=\"p15\">For me, the application of the first great commandment can sometimes feel abstract, even daunting. Gratefully, as I consider further words of Jesus, this commandment becomes much more graspable: \u201cIf ye love me, keep my commandments.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\">5<\/sup><\/a> This I can do. I can love Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ, which then leads to prayer, scripture study, and temple worship. We love the Father and the Son through the payment of tithes, keeping the Sabbath day holy, living a virtuous and chaste life, and being obedient.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159164883\" id=\"p16\">Loving the Lord is often measured in small daily deeds, footsteps on the covenant path: for young people, using social media to build up rather than tear down; leaving the party, movie, or activity where standards might be challenged; showing reverence for things sacred.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159164892\" id=\"p19\">Consider this tender example. It was fast Sunday as Vance<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\">6<\/sup><\/a> and I knocked on the door of a small, humble home. We and other deacons in the quorum had come to expect the words \u201cPlease come in,\u201d yelled warmly in a thick German accent loud enough to hear through the door. Sister Muellar was one of several immigrant widows in the ward. She couldn\u2019t answer the door very easily, as she was legally blind. As we stepped inside the dimly lit home, she greeted us with kind questions: What are your names? How are you doing? Do you love the Lord? We answered and shared that we came to receive her fast offering. Even at our young age, her meager circumstances were readily apparent, and her faith-filled response was profoundly touching: \u201cI placed a dime on the counter earlier this morning. I am so grateful to offer my fast offering. Would you be kind enough to place it in the envelope and fill out my fast-offering receipt?\u201d Her love of the Lord lifted our faith each time we left her home.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159164899\" id=\"p20\">King Benjamin promised remarkable power for those who follow the first great commandment. \u201cI would desire that ye should consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments. \u2026 They are blessed in all things, \u2026 and if they hold out faithful to the end they are received into heaven \u2026 in a state of never-ending happiness.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\">7<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159164905\" id=\"p21\">Loving the Lord leads to eternal happiness!<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"159164914\" id=\"title5\">Love Your Neighbor<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"159164923\" id=\"p22\">Jesus then said, \u201cAnd the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\">8<\/sup><\/a> This is the second tower of the bridge.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159164932\" id=\"p23\">Here Jesus bridges our heavenly upward gaze, to love the Lord, with our earthly outward gaze, to love our fellow men and women. One is interdependent on the other. Love of the Lord is not complete if we neglect our neighbors. This outward love includes all of God\u2019s children without regard to gender, social class, race, sexuality, income, age, or ethnicity. We seek out those who are hurt and broken, the marginalized, for \u201call are alike unto God.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\">9<\/sup><\/a> We \u201csuccor the weak, lift up the hands which hang down, and strengthen the feeble knees.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\">10<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159164941\" id=\"p24\">Consider this example: Brother Evans<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\">11<\/sup><\/a> was surprised when he was prompted to stop his car and knock on an unknown door of an unknown family. When a widowed mother of over 10 answered the door, their difficult circumstances and great needs became readily apparent to him. The first was simple, paint for their home, which was followed by many years of temporal and spiritual ministering to this family.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159164950\" id=\"p35\">This thankful mother later wrote of her heaven-sent friend: \u201cYou have spent your life reaching out to the least of us. How I would love to hear the things the Lord has to say to you as He expresses His appreciation for the good you have done financially and spiritually for the people that only you and He will ever know about. Thank you for blessing us in so many ways, \u2026 for the missionaries you provided for. \u2026 I often wonder if the Lord picked on you exclusively or if you were just the one who listened.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159164959\" id=\"p25\">To love your neighbor includes Christlike deeds of kindness and service. Can you let go of grudges, forgive enemies, welcome and minister to your neighbors, and assist the elderly? You will each be inspired as you build your tower of love for neighbor.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159164968\" id=\"p26\">President RussellÂ M. Nelson taught: \u201cGiving help to others\u2014making a conscientious effort to care about others as much as or <em>more<\/em> than we care about ourselves\u2014is our joy. Especially \u2026 when it is not convenient and when it takes us out of our comfort zone. <em>Living<\/em> that second great commandment is the <em>key<\/em> to becoming a true disciple of Jesus Christ.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\">12<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"159164977\" id=\"title6\">An Interdependency<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"159164986\" id=\"p27\">Jesus further taught, \u201cOn these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\">13<\/sup><\/a> This is very instructive. There is an important interdependency between loving the Lord and loving one another. For the Golden Gate Bridge to perform its designed function, both towers are equally strong and with equal power to bear the weight of the suspension cables, the roadway, and the traffic crossing the bridge. Without this engineering symmetry, the bridge could be compromised, even leading to collapse. For any suspension bridge to do what it was built to do, its towers must function together in complete harmony. Likewise, our ability to follow Jesus Christ depends upon our strength and power to live the first and second commandments with balance and equal devotion to both.<\/p>\n<img alt=\"Golden Gate Bridge.\" id=\"img6\" src=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/995fe879f36511eeb853eeeeac1e4830cca475ed/full/500%2C/0/default\" data-img-id=\"995fe879f36511eeb853eeeeac1e4830cca475ed\" srcset=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/995fe879f36511eeb853eeeeac1e4830cca475ed/full/60%2C/0/default 60w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/995fe879f36511eeb853eeeeac1e4830cca475ed/full/100%2C/0/default 100w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/995fe879f36511eeb853eeeeac1e4830cca475ed/full/200%2C/0/default 200w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/995fe879f36511eeb853eeeeac1e4830cca475ed/full/250%2C/0/default 250w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/995fe879f36511eeb853eeeeac1e4830cca475ed/full/320%2C/0/default 320w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/995fe879f36511eeb853eeeeac1e4830cca475ed/full/500%2C/0/default 500w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/995fe879f36511eeb853eeeeac1e4830cca475ed/full/640%2C/0/default 640w\" data-assetId=\"995fe879f36511eeb853eeeeac1e4830cca475ed\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"281\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.7793594306049823\"/>\n<p data-aid=\"159164993\" id=\"p28\">The increasing contention in the world suggests, however, that we at times fail to see or remember this. Some are so focused on keeping the commandments that they show little tolerance of those they see as less righteous. Some find it difficult to love those who are choosing to live their lives outside of the covenant or even away from any religious participation.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159165000\" id=\"p29\">Alternatively, there are those who emphasize the importance of loving others without acknowledgment that we are all accountable to God. Some refuse entirely the notion that there is such a thing as absolute truth or right and wrong and believe that the only thing required of us is complete tolerance and acceptance of the choices of others. Either of these imbalances could cause your spiritual bridge to tip or even fall.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159165007\" id=\"p30\">President DallinÂ H. Oaks described this when he said: \u201cWe are commanded to love everyone, since Jesus\u2019s parable of the good Samaritan teaches that everyone is our neighbor. But our zeal to keep this second commandment must not cause us to forget the first, to love God with all our heart, soul, and mind.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note14\"><sup class=\"marker\">14<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"159165015\" id=\"title7\">Conclusion<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"159165022\" id=\"p31\">So the question for each of us is, How do we build our own bridge of faith and devotion\u2014erecting tall bridge towers of both loving God and loving our neighbors? Well, we just start. Our initial efforts might look like a plan on the back of a napkin or an early-stage blueprint of the bridge we hope to construct. It might consist of a few realistic goals to understand the Lord\u2019s gospel more or to vow to judge others less. No one is too young or too old to begin.<\/p>\n<img alt=\"Bridge design sketch.\" id=\"img7\" src=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/0fd1a557f36811eea856eeeeac1e2f10169aea95/full/500%2C/0/default\" data-img-id=\"0fd1a557f36811eea856eeeeac1e2f10169aea95\" srcset=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/0fd1a557f36811eea856eeeeac1e2f10169aea95/full/60%2C/0/default 60w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/0fd1a557f36811eea856eeeeac1e2f10169aea95/full/100%2C/0/default 100w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/0fd1a557f36811eea856eeeeac1e2f10169aea95/full/200%2C/0/default 200w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/0fd1a557f36811eea856eeeeac1e2f10169aea95/full/250%2C/0/default 250w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/0fd1a557f36811eea856eeeeac1e2f10169aea95/full/320%2C/0/default 320w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/0fd1a557f36811eea856eeeeac1e2f10169aea95/full/500%2C/0/default 500w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/0fd1a557f36811eea856eeeeac1e2f10169aea95/full/640%2C/0/default 640w\" data-assetId=\"0fd1a557f36811eea856eeeeac1e2f10169aea95\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"413\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.2106537530266344\"/>\n<p data-aid=\"159165029\" id=\"p32\">Over time, with prayerful and thoughtful planning, rough ideas are refined.
