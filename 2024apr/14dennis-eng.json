As we read together in the evenings, I loved helping my children understand the symbolism the author was using to teach deeper principles, even gospel principles.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159161367\" id=\"p2\">I knew this was sinking in one day when my younger son was in his early teens. He had started a new book and just wanted to enjoy the story, but his mind kept trying to find the deeper meaning in everything he was reading. He was frustrated, but I was smiling inside.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159161370\" id=\"p3\">Jesus taught through stories and symbols<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\">1<\/sup><\/a>\u2014a mustard seed to teach the power of faith,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\">2<\/sup><\/a> a lost sheep to teach the worth of souls,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\">3<\/sup><\/a> a prodigal son to teach the character of God.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\">4<\/sup><\/a> His parables were symbols through which He could teach deeper lessons to those who had \u201cears to hear.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\">5<\/sup><\/a> But those not seeking the deeper meaning would not understand,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\">6<\/sup><\/a> just as many who read those same books I read to my children never knew there were deeper meanings and so much more to get out of those stories.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159161373\" id=\"p4\">When God the Father offered His Only Begotten Son as a sacrifice for us, Jesus Christ Himself became the highest symbol of our Father in Heaven\u2019s undying love for each of us.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\">7<\/sup><\/a> Jesus Christ became the Lamb of God.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\">8<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159161376\" id=\"p5\">We have the privilege and blessing of being invited into a covenant relationship with God, in which our own lives can become a symbol of that covenant. Covenants create the kind of relationship that allows God to mold and change us over time and lift us to become more like the Savior, drawing us closer and closer to Him and our Father<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\">9<\/sup><\/a> and eventually preparing us to enter Their presence.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159161379\" id=\"p6\">Each person on earth is a beloved son or daughter of God.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\">10<\/sup><\/a> When we choose to be part of a covenant, it enhances and deepens our relationship with Him. President Russell M. Nelson has taught that when we choose to make covenants with God, our relationship with Him can become much closer than it was before our covenant, and it enables Him to bless us with an extra measure of His mercy and love, a covenantal love referred to as <em>hesed<\/em> in the Hebrew language.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\">11<\/sup><\/a> The covenant path is all about our relationship with God\u2014our <em>hesed<\/em> relationship with Him.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\">12<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159161382\" id=\"p7\">Our Father wants a deeper relationship with all His sons and daughters,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\">13<\/sup><\/a> but it is our choice. As we choose to draw nearer to Him through a <em>covenant<\/em> relationship, it allows Him to draw nearer to us<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note14\"><sup class=\"marker\">14<\/sup><\/a> and more fully bless us.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159161385\" id=\"p8\">God sets the conditions and obligations of the covenants we make.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note15\"><sup class=\"marker\">15<\/sup><\/a> When we choose to enter into that relationship, we witness to Him, through the symbolic actions of each covenant, that we are willing to abide by the conditions He has set.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note16\"><sup class=\"marker\">16<\/sup><\/a> Through honoring our covenants, we enable God to pour out the multitude of promised blessings associated with those covenants,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note17\"><sup class=\"marker\">17<\/sup><\/a> including increased power to change and become more like our Savior. Jesus Christ is at the center of all covenants we make, and covenant blessings are made possible because of His atoning sacrifice.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note18\"><sup class=\"marker\">18<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159161387\" id=\"p9\">Baptism by immersion is the symbolic gate through which we enter into a covenant relationship with God. Being immersed in the water and coming up again is symbolic of the Savior\u2019s death and Resurrection to new life.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note19\"><sup class=\"marker\">19<\/sup><\/a> As we are baptized, we symbolically die and are born again into the family of Christ and show we are willing to take His name upon us.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note20\"><sup class=\"marker\">20<\/sup><\/a> We ourselves embody that covenant symbolism. In the New Testament we read, \u201cFor as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note21\"><sup class=\"marker\">21<\/sup><\/a> With our baptism we symbolically put on Christ.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159161390\" id=\"p10\">The ordinance of the sacrament also points to the Savior. The bread and water are symbolic of Christ\u2019s flesh and blood shed for us.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note22\"><sup class=\"marker\">22<\/sup><\/a> The gift of His Atonement is symbolically offered to us each week when a priesthood holder, representing the Savior Himself, offers us the bread and water. As we perform the action of eating and drinking the emblems of His flesh and blood, Christ symbolically becomes a part of us.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note23\"><sup class=\"marker\">23<\/sup><\/a> We again put on Christ as we make a new covenant each week.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note24\"><sup class=\"marker\">24<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159161392\" id=\"p11\">As we make covenants with God in the house of the Lord, we further deepen our relationship with Him.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note25\"><sup class=\"marker\">25<\/sup><\/a> Everything we do in the temple points to our Father\u2019s plan for us, at the heart of which is the Savior and His atoning sacrifice.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note26\"><sup class=\"marker\">26<\/sup><\/a> The Lord will teach us line upon line<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note27\"><sup class=\"marker\">27<\/sup><\/a> through the symbolism of the ordinances and covenants as we open our hearts and prayerfully seek to understand the deeper meanings.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159161396\" id=\"p12\">As part of the temple endowment, we are <em>authorized<\/em> to wear the garment of the holy priesthood. It is both a sacred obligation and a sacred privilege.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159161400\" id=\"p13\">In many religious traditions, special outer clothing is worn as a symbol of a person\u2019s beliefs and commitment to God,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note28\"><sup class=\"marker\">28<\/sup><\/a> and ceremonial clothing is often worn by those leading worship services. Those sacred vestments carry deep meaning for those who wear them. We read in scripture that in ancient times, sacred ceremonial clothing was also worn in conjunction with temple rituals.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note29\"><sup class=\"marker\">29<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159161403\" id=\"p14\">As members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, those of us who have chosen to make covenants with God in the house of the Lord wear sacred ceremonial outer clothing during temple worship, symbolic of the clothing worn in ancient temple rituals. We also wear the garment of the holy priesthood, both during temple worship <em>and<\/em> in our everyday lives.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note30\"><sup class=\"marker\">30<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159161406\" id=\"p15\">The garment of the holy priesthood is deeply symbolic and <em>also<\/em> points to the Savior.

As we put on the garment of the holy priesthood each day, that beautiful symbol becomes a part of us.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159161409\" id=\"p16\">In the New Testament book of Romans, we read: \u201cThe night is far spent, the day is at hand: let us therefore cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light. \u2026 Put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note33\"><sup class=\"marker\">33<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159161412\" id=\"p17\">I am so grateful for the privilege of wearing the garment of the holy priesthood to remind me that the Savior and the blessings of His infinite Atonement constantly cover me throughout my mortal journey. It also reminds me that as I keep the covenants I have made with God in the house of the Lord, I have symbolically put on Christ, who Himself is an armor of light. He will protect me from evil,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note34\"><sup class=\"marker\">34<\/sup><\/a> give me power and increased capacity,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note35\"><sup class=\"marker\">35<\/sup><\/a> and be my light and guide<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note36\"><sup class=\"marker\">36<\/sup><\/a> through the darkness and difficulties of this world.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159161415\" id=\"p18\">There is deep and beautiful symbolic meaning in the garment of the holy priesthood and its relationship to Christ. I believe that my willingness<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note37\"><sup class=\"marker\">37<\/sup><\/a> to wear the holy garment becomes <em>my<\/em> symbol to Him.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note38\"><sup class=\"marker\">38<\/sup><\/a> It is my own personal sign to God, not a sign to others.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note39\"><sup class=\"marker\">39<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159161418\" id=\"p19\">I am so grateful for my Savior, Jesus Christ.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note40\"><sup class=\"marker\">40<\/sup><\/a> His atoning sacrifice for us became the greatest symbol of His and our Father in Heaven\u2019s infinite love for each of us,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note41\"><sup class=\"marker\">41<\/sup><\/a> with the tangible symbols of that love and sacrifice\u2014the marks in the Savior\u2019s hands, feet, and side\u2014remaining even after His Resurrection.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note42\"><sup class=\"marker\">42<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159161421\" id=\"p20\">As I keep my covenants and obligations with God, including wearing the garment of the holy priesthood, my very life can become a personal symbol of my love and deep gratitude for my Savior, Jesus Christ, and my desire to have Him with me always.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159161424\" id=\"p21\">If you have not yet done so, I invite you to choose a deeper relationship with God by making covenants with Him in the house of the Lord. Study the talks of our prophet (including the beautiful teachings in the footnotes of his talks, which most conference talks have). He has spoken repeatedly about covenants for years and especially since becoming President of the Church. Learn from his teachings about the beautiful blessings and increased power and capacity that can be yours through making and keeping covenants with God.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note43\"><sup class=\"marker\">43<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159161428\" id=\"p22\">The <cite>General Handbook<\/cite> states that it is not required to have a mission call or be engaged to be married to make temple covenants.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note44\"><sup class=\"marker\">44<\/sup><\/a> A person must be at least 18 years old, no longer be attending high school or the equivalent, and be a member of the Church for at least one year. There are also standards of personal holiness required.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note45\"><sup class=\"marker\">45<\/sup><\/a> If you have the desire to deepen your relationship with your Father in Heaven and Jesus Christ by making sacred covenants in the house of the Lord, I invite you to speak with your bishop or branch president and let him know of your desires. He will help you know how to prepare to receive and honor those covenants.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159161432\" id=\"p23\">Through a covenant relationship with God, our own lives can become a living symbol of our commitment to and deep love for our Father in Heaven, our <em>hesed<\/em> for Him,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note46\"><sup class=\"marker\">46<\/sup><\/a> and our desire to progress and eventually become like our Savior, being prepared to one day enter Their presence. I testify that the great blessings of that covenant relationship are well worth the price.
