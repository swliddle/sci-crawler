I have Christ!\u201d Ashley knelt down right in the middle of the playground, folded her arms, and prayed to Heavenly Father. The moment she opened her eyes, a girl her age was standing there asking her if she wanted to play. Ashley came to know, \u201cWe are important to the Lord, and we are never truly alone.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"159163342\" id=\"p20\">Sometimes you may want to <em>know<\/em> why something hard is happening in your life or why you didn\u2019t receive a blessing you prayed for.
