You are His precious child and of great worth.<\/p>\n<\/header>\n<div class=\"body-block\">\n<p data-aid=\"156931835\" id=\"p1\">Six years ago our family was traveling at night just outside the city of Oxford. As is often the case with young children, we needed to stop, so we found a service station with an array of shops and restaurants. With precision, we filed out of the car, visited the services, and filed back in, resuming our journey.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931838\" id=\"p2\">Fifteen minutes later our eldest son asked a significant question: \u201cWhere is Jasper?\u201d Jasper sits on his own at the back of the car. We assumed he had fallen asleep or was hiding or playing a trick on us.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931842\" id=\"p3\">As his brother inspected the back of the car more closely, we discovered our five-year-old son was not there. Our hearts filled with dread. As we made our way back to the service station, we pleaded with Heavenly Father that Jasper would be kept safe. We called the police and informed them of the situation.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931845\" id=\"p4\">When we anxiously arrived, more than 40 minutes later, we found two police vehicles in the car park, lights flashing. Inside one of them was Jasper, playing with the buttons. I will never forget the joy we felt in being reunited with him.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931849\" id=\"p5\">Many of the Savior\u2019s parabolic teachings focus on gathering, restoring, or striving to find that which has been scattered or lost. Among these are the parables of the lost sheep, the lost coin, and the lost son.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\">1<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931853\" id=\"p6\">As this incident with Jasper has played in my mind over the years, I have reflected on the divine identity and importance of God\u2019s children, the redemptive power of Jesus Christ, and the perfect love of a Father in Heaven, who knows you and me. I hope to bear witness of these truths today.<\/p>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"156931856\" id=\"title2\">I. Children of God<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"156931859\" id=\"p7\">Life is challenging. Many people feel overwhelmed, alone, isolated, or exhausted. When things are difficult, we may feel that we have wandered or fallen behind. Knowing that we are all children of God and members of His eternal family will restore a sense of belonging and purpose.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\">2<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931861\" id=\"p8\">President M. Russell Ballard shared: \u201cThere is one important identity we all share now and forever. \u2026 That is that you are and have always been a son or daughter of God. \u2026 Understanding this truth\u2014really understanding it and embracing it\u2014is life-changing.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\">3<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931862\" id=\"p9\">Do not misunderstand or devalue how important you are to your Father in Heaven. You are not an accidental by-product of nature, a cosmic orphan, or the result of matter plus time plus chance. Where there is design, there is a designer.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931864\" id=\"p10\">Your life has meaning and purpose. The ongoing Restoration of the gospel of Jesus Christ brings light and understanding regarding your divine identity. You are a beloved child of Heavenly Father. You are the subject matter of all those parables and teachings. God loves you so much that He sent His Son to heal, rescue, and redeem you.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\">4<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931867\" id=\"p11\">Jesus Christ recognized the divine nature and eternal worth of each person.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\">5<\/sup><\/a> He explained how the two great commandments to love God and love our neighbor are the foundation of all of God\u2019s commandments.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\">6<\/sup><\/a> One of our divine responsibilities is to care for those in need.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\">7<\/sup><\/a> This is why as disciples of Jesus Christ we \u201cbear one another\u2019s burdens, \u2026 mourn with those that mourn \u2026 , and comfort those that stand in need of comfort.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\">8<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931870\" id=\"p12\">Religion is not only about our relationship with God; it is also about our relationship with each other. Elder Jeffrey R. Holland explained that the English word <em>religion<\/em> comes from the Latin <em>religare<\/em>, meaning \u201cto tie\u201d or, more literally, \u201cto re-tie.\u201d Thus, \u201ctrue religion [is] the tie that binds us to God and to each other.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\">9<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931873\" id=\"p13\">How we treat one another truly matters. President Russell M. Nelson teaches, \u201cThe Savior\u2019s message is clear: His <em>true<\/em> disciples build, lift, encourage, persuade, and inspire.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\">10<\/sup><\/a> This is even more important when our fellow travelers feel lost, alone, forgotten, or removed.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931876\" id=\"p14\">We do not have to look far to find people who are struggling. We can start by helping someone in our own family, congregation, or local community. We can also seek to relieve the suffering of the 700 million people living in extreme poverty<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\">11<\/sup><\/a> or the 100 million people who are forcibly displaced due to persecution, conflict, and identity-based violence.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\">12<\/sup><\/a> Jesus Christ is the perfect example of caring for those in need\u2014the hungry, the stranger, the sick, the poor, the imprisoned. His work is our work.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931879\" id=\"p15\">Elder Gerrit W. Gong teaches that \u201cour journey to God is often found together.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\">13<\/sup><\/a> As such, our wards should be a refuge for all of God\u2019s children. Are we passively attending church or actively creating communities whose purpose is to worship, remember Christ, and minister to one another?<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note14\"><sup class=\"marker\">14<\/sup><\/a> We can heed President Nelson\u2019s counsel to judge less, love more, and extend the pure love of Jesus Christ through our words and actions.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note15\"><sup class=\"marker\">15<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"156931881\" id=\"title3\">II. The Redemptive Power of Jesus Christ<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"156931885\" id=\"p16\">The Atonement of Jesus Christ is the supreme expression of our Heavenly Father\u2019s love for His children.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note16\"><sup class=\"marker\">16<\/sup><\/a> The word <em>atonement<\/em> describes the setting \u201cat one\u201d of those who have been estranged or separated.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931888\" id=\"p17\">Our Savior\u2019s mission was to provide both a way to return to Heavenly Father and relief in the journey.
