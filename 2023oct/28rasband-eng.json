Nelson calls \u201cthe most important thing taking place on earth today. Nothing else compares in magnitude, nothing else compares in importance, nothing else compares in majesty.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\">1<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931673\" id=\"p2\">The gathering is the ultimate recognition that \u201cthe worth of souls is great in the sight of God.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\">2<\/sup><\/a> It is as simple as that. We are gathering God\u2019s children in these last days that they might have \u201cblessings poured out upon their heads\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\">3<\/sup><\/a> and the promises of \u201cthe riches of eternity.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\">4<\/sup><\/a> It follows that to gather Israel we need missionaries\u2014many more than are serving.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\">5<\/sup><\/a> Today I am speaking to the many seasoned seniors in the Church who could serve as missionaries. The Lord needs you. We need you in New York and Chicago, Australia and Africa, Thailand and Mexico, and everywhere in between.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931679\" id=\"p3\">Let me take you back to the year 2015. I was a newly called member of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles. One of the wonderful responsibilities we carry as Apostles is to assign missionaries to their fields of labor. I had participated as a Seventy in the process,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\">6<\/sup><\/a> but now as an Apostle, I felt the full weight of the assignment. I began with prayerfully placing a great number of young elders and sisters, one by one, in missions around the world. Then I turned to the senior couples. There were 10 on the list. Not very many. Surprised, I asked my associate from the Missionary Department, \u201cHow many do we need this week to fill the requests?\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931683\" id=\"p4\">He responded, \u201c300.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931690\" id=\"p5\">That sobering moment has stayed with me: 10 couples to fill 300 requests.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931696\" id=\"p6\">President Russell M. Nelson has encouraged couples to \u201cget on their knees and ask Heavenly Father if the time is right for them to serve a mission.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\">7<\/sup><\/a> Of all the qualifications, he said, \u201ca <em>desire<\/em> to serve may be the most important.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\">8<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931700\" id=\"p7\">As the scripture says, \u201cIf ye have desires to serve God ye are called to the work.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\">9<\/sup><\/a> That work is all about the law of the harvest. We read in John, \u201cBoth he that soweth and he that reapeth may rejoice together.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\">10<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931707\" id=\"p8\">I have seen the law of the harvest fulfilled in my own family.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931713\" id=\"p9\">Some years ago I was visiting family, when the bishop asked me to conclude the sacrament service.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\">11<\/sup><\/a> As I was coming down from the stand, a woman approached me with her seven children and introduced herself as Sister Rebecca Guzman.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931719\" id=\"p10\">She asked, \u201cElder Rasband, do you know Rulon and Verda Rasband?\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931725\" id=\"p11\">I beamed and replied, \u201cThey are my parents.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931732\" id=\"p12\">You can see where this is going. With Rebecca\u2019s permission, who is here with family in the Conference Center, I share her family\u2019s story.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\">12<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<img alt=\"Sister Verda and Elder Rulon Rasband.\" id=\"img1\" src=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/9588d7695d8911eeb6e9eeeeac1eec9d6d2758c2/full/500,/0/default\" data-img-id=\"9588d7695d8911eeb6e9eeeeac1eec9d6d2758c2\" srcset=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/9588d7695d8911eeb6e9eeeeac1eec9d6d2758c2/full/60,/0/default 60w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/9588d7695d8911eeb6e9eeeeac1eec9d6d2758c2/full/100,/0/default 100w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/9588d7695d8911eeb6e9eeeeac1eec9d6d2758c2/full/200,/0/default 200w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/9588d7695d8911eeb6e9eeeeac1eec9d6d2758c2/full/250,/0/default 250w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/9588d7695d8911eeb6e9eeeeac1eec9d6d2758c2/full/320,/0/default 320w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/9588d7695d8911eeb6e9eeeeac1eec9d6d2758c2/full/500,/0/default 500w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/9588d7695d8911eeb6e9eeeeac1eec9d6d2758c2/full/640,/0/default 640w\" data-assetId=\"9588d7695d8911eeb6e9eeeeac1eec9d6d2758c2\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"323\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.5479876160990713\"/>\n<p data-aid=\"156931739\" id=\"p13\">My parents, Elder Rulon and Sister Verda Rasband, were serving as a senior couple in the Florida Fort Lauderdale Mission.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\">13<\/sup><\/a> They were proselyting and by divine guidance knocked on the door of Rebecca\u2019s home. She was just a teenager and loved listening to the music of the Osmonds, in particular our friend Donny\u2014who is here with us today.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note14\"><sup class=\"marker\">14<\/sup><\/a> She had listened to their media interviews and learned they were members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. She felt there was something different about them, and thinking it might be their religion, Rebecca spent two years researching the Church\u2019s beliefs in the school library. So, when a kindly-looking couple knocked on her family\u2019s door and introduced themselves as Latter-day Saint missionaries, she was taken back.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931746\" id=\"p14\">\u201cMy mother told me to get rid of them,\u201d Rebecca later wrote, \u201cbut my heart said, \u2018No.\u2019 I looked into their faces, and I felt so much warmth and love. The memory still brings tears to my eyes and deep emotion to my heart.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note15\"><sup class=\"marker\">15<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931754\" id=\"p15\">Rebecca invited them in, and my missionary parents shared a message with her, her two younger sisters, and, despite her objections, her mother.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931762\" id=\"p16\">Rebecca described to me: \u201cBoth your parents were wonderful in explaining any questions we had. I can still see their faces as if there was light surrounding them. We always hugged your mother when she left, and she always made a point of helping my mother feel comfortable and respected. Your father always had a sparkle in his eyes as he was teaching us about Jesus Christ. He tried to include my father in discussions and eventually won him over. My father was a chef at a local country club and started cooking dinners for your parents, including making your father\u2019s favorite, key lime pie.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note16\"><sup class=\"marker\">16<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931770\" id=\"p17\">When Elder and Sister Rasband asked Rebecca and her family to read the Book of Mormon, Rebecca did so in five days. She wanted to be baptized immediately, but the other members of her family were not ready. After four months, Rebecca insisted she be baptized and join the true Church. She recalled, \u201cEvery fiber of my soul knew it was true.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note17\"><sup class=\"marker\">17<\/sup><\/a> On April 5, 1979, missionaries baptized 19-year-old Rebecca, her mother, and two sisters.

You are a remarkable force for good, seasoned in the Church, and poised to encourage and rescue God\u2019s children.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931803\" id=\"p20\">Some of you might be thinking: \u201cBut what about leaving the grandchildren? We would miss family milestones, birthdays, friends, and even our pets.\u201d If I had asked my mother why she and Dad went on a mission, I know she would have said this: \u201cI have grandchildren. I want them to know that your father and I served in the mission field, we wanted to set an example for our posterity, and we were blessed, so blessed.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931812\" id=\"p21\">As I have visited missions around the world, I have seen the remarkable service of our legion of senior missionaries. It is clear they are happy doing \u201cthe will of the Lord\u201d and being about \u201cthe Lord\u2019s business.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note18\"><sup class=\"marker\">18<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931821\" id=\"p22\">For some, and we hope thousands of you, full-time missionary service in another corner of the world will be just the right place.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note19\"><sup class=\"marker\">19<\/sup><\/a> For others, serving a Church-service mission at home might be preferable. Because of health issues and other circumstances, there are those who are unable to serve. We understand those situations, and it would be my hope you might find ways to support those who are serving. Follow the prophet\u2019s counsel and pray to know what the Lord would have you do.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932830\" id=\"p23\">Mission fields around the world are pleading for your help. President Nelson has said of our senior missionaries, \u201cThey are young in spirit, wise, and willing to work.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note20\"><sup class=\"marker\">20<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932840\" id=\"p24\">Out in the field, you have a smorgasbord of opportunities: you may serve in mission offices or temples, strengthen young missionaries, bolster small branches, work in FamilySearch centers or at historic sites, teach institute, provide humanitarian service, work with young adults, help in employment centers or on Church farms. The particulars of ways to serve, what best suits you, where you are needed, and how you can get ready to go are addressed on the website \u201cSenior Missionary.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note21\"><sup class=\"marker\">21<\/sup><\/a> You can also talk with your bishop or branch president.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932848\" id=\"p25\">I have called many couples to serve and watched as the Light of Christ has filled their countenances.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note22\"><sup class=\"marker\">22<\/sup><\/a> At their return, they have described growing closer to the Lord and closer to one another, feeling the Spirit of the Lord pour down upon them, and knowing they are making a difference.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note23\"><sup class=\"marker\">23<\/sup><\/a> Who would not want that?<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932857\" id=\"p26\">A mission might be the greatest chapter in a couple\u2019s life.

The Lord has said in latter-day scripture, \u201cAnd if it so be that you should labor all your days in crying repentance unto this people, and bring, save it be one soul unto me, how great shall be your joy with him in the kingdom of my Father!\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note25\"><sup class=\"marker\">25<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932872\" id=\"p28\">Isaiah gave us a poetic description of what it means to serve in the mission \u201cfield.\u201d Scripture tells us \u201cthe field is the world.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note26\"><sup class=\"marker\">26<\/sup><\/a> This great ancient prophet wrote, \u201cFor ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace: the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note27\"><sup class=\"marker\">27<\/sup><\/a> The mountains, hills, fields, and trees can be likened to mission presidents, bishops, district leaders, members, and those who seek the truth but \u201cthey know not where to find it.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note28\"><sup class=\"marker\">28<\/sup><\/a> They will testify that the senior missionaries change the very landscape with their testimony of our Savior and Redeemer, Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932875\" id=\"p29\">As an Apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ, I ask you to serve as a missionary in the gathering of Israel and perhaps even serve again. We need you\u2014we need you. We are grateful to you seniors for the lives you have led and the examples you have been in your homes, wards, and stakes. I now invite you to take your know-how, coupled with your time-honored testimonies, and go on a mission.
