One hundred sixty-seven years ago this very week, on October 4, 1856, President Brigham Young was surprised to learn that two handcart companies, led by Edward Martin and James Willie, were still hundreds of miles from Salt Lake, with winter fast approaching.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\">1<\/sup><\/a> The very next day, not far from where we meet today, President Young stood before the Saints and declared: \u201cMany of our brethren and sisters are on the plains with hand-carts, and they must be brought here. \u2026 Go and bring in those people now on the plains.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\">2<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932103\" id=\"p3\">Just two days later, the first rescue parties departed in search of the handcart pioneers.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932111\" id=\"p4\">A member of the Willie company described the desperate situation prior to the arrival of the main rescue team. He shared: \u201c[Just] when it seemed all would be lost, \u2026 and there seemed little left to live for, like a thunderbolt out of the clear sky, God answered our prayers. A rescue party, bringing food and supplies \u2026 , came into sight. \u2026 How we thanked God for our rescue.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\">3<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932119\" id=\"p5\">These rescuers were heroes to the pioneers, putting their own lives at risk in extreme weather conditions to bring as many as possible safely home. One such hero was Ephraim Hanks.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932127\" id=\"p6\">In mid-October, and unaware of the handcart predicament, Hanks was returning to his home in Salt Lake following a trip when, during the night, he was awakened by a voice saying, \u201cThe hand-cart people are in trouble and you are wanted; will you go and help them?\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932136\" id=\"p7\">With that question ringing in his mind, he hurried back to Salt Lake City. And upon hearing President Heber C. Kimball call for additional volunteers, Hanks set out the very next day, on his own, to the rescue. Moving quickly, he overtook other rescuers en route, and upon reaching the Martin company, Hanks recalled, \u201cThe sight that met my gaze as I entered their camp can never be erased from my memory \u2026 [and] was enough to touch the stoutest heart.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\">4<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932143\" id=\"p8\">Ephraim Hanks spent days moving from tent to tent blessing the sick. He related that \u201cin scores of instances, when we administered to the sick, and rebuked the diseases in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, the sufferers would rally at once; they were healed almost instantly.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\">5<\/sup><\/a> Ephraim Hanks will forever be a hero to those handcart pioneers.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932152\" id=\"p9\">Similar to that remarkable rescue, events which impact our lives and even the course of history are frequently the result of decisions and achievements of individual men and women\u2014great artists, scientists, business leaders, and politicians. These extraordinary individuals are often honored as heroes, with monuments and memorials built to commemorate their exploits.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932160\" id=\"p27\">When I was a young boy, my first heroes were athletes. My earliest memories are of collecting baseball cards with the pictures and statistics of Major League Baseball players. \u201cHero worship\u201d as a child can be fun and innocent, as when children dress up as their favorite superheroes for Halloween. Although we admire and respect many talented and remarkable men and women for their abilities and contributions, the degree to which they are revered, if taken to an excess, can be the equivalent of the children of Israel worshipping a golden calf in the desert of Sinai.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932169\" id=\"p10\">As adults, what was once innocent childhood fun can become a stumbling block when \u201chero worship\u201d of politicians, bloggers, influencers, athletes, or musicians causes us to look \u201cbeyond the mark\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\">6<\/sup><\/a> and lose sight of what is truly essential.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932178\" id=\"p11\">For the children of Israel, the challenge was not the gold that they brought with them on their journey to the promised land but rather what they allowed the gold to become: an idol, which then became the object of their worship, turning their attention away from Jehovah, who had parted the Red Sea and delivered them from bondage. Their focus on the calf impacted their ability to worship the true God.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\">7<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932187\" id=\"p12\"><em>The<\/em> hero\u2014our hero, now and always\u2014is Jesus Christ, and anything or anyone that distracts us from His teachings, as found in the scriptures and through the words of living prophets, can negatively impact our progress on the covenant path. Before the Creation of this world, we looked to Jesus Christ when it became clear that the plan proposed by Father in Heaven, which included our opportunity to progress and become like Him, was being challenged.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932197\" id=\"p13\">Not only was Jesus Christ the leader in defending our Father\u2019s plan, but He would also play the most crucial role in its implementation. He responded to the Father and volunteered to offer Himself \u201ca ransom for all,\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\">8<\/sup><\/a> to pay a debt that each of us would incur through sin but could not pay on our own.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932206\" id=\"p14\">President Dallin H. Oaks has taught, \u201c[Jesus Christ] has done everything that is essential for our journey through mortality toward the destiny outlined in the plan of our Heavenly Father.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\">9<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932214\" id=\"p15\">In the Garden of Gethsemane, when faced with such an overwhelming task, the Savior bravely stated, \u201cNot my will, but thine, be done,\u201d and proceeded to take upon Himself the combined pains, the sicknesses, and the suffering for the sins of all who would ever live.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\">10<\/sup><\/a> In a perfect act of obedience and commitment, Jesus Christ completed <em>the<\/em> supreme heroic act in all of creation, culminating in His glorious Resurrection.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932223\" id=\"p16\">In our most recent general conference, President Russell M. Nelson reminded us: \u201cWhatever questions or problems you have, the answer is always found in the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. Learn more about His Atonement, His love, His mercy, His doctrine, and His restored gospel of healing and progression. Turn to Him! Follow Him!\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\">11<\/sup><\/a> And I would add, \u201cChoose Him.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932230\" id=\"p17\">In our complex world, it can be tempting to turn to society\u2019s heroes in an effort to provide clarity to life when it may seem confusing or overwhelming. We buy the clothes they sponsor, we embrace the politics they espouse, and we follow their suggestions shared on social media. This might be fine for a temporary diversion, but we must be watchful that this form of hero worship does not become our golden calf. Choosing the right hero has eternal consequences.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932240\" id=\"p18\">When our family arrived in Spain to begin our service as mission leaders, we found a framed quote shared by Elder Neal A. Maxwell that has relevance to the heroes we choose to follow. He stated, \u201cIf you have not chosen the kingdom of God first, it will in the end make no difference what you have chosen instead.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\">12<\/sup><\/a> Brothers and sisters, it is by choosing Jesus Christ, the King of kings, that we choose the kingdom of God. <em>Any<\/em> other choice is the equivalent of choosing the arm of flesh, or a golden calf, and will ultimately fail us.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932251\" id=\"p19\">In the Old Testament book of Daniel, we read the account of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who clearly knew which hero to choose\u2014and it was not any of the gods of King Nebuchadnezzar. They confidently declared:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932257\" id=\"p25\">\u201cOur God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace. \u2026 <\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932263\" id=\"p26\">\u201cBut if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\">13<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932269\" id=\"p20\">As the Apostle Paul taught, \u201cThere be gods many,\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note14\"><sup class=\"marker\">14<\/sup><\/a> and, I may add, heroes many to whom we are invited to bow down, to worship, and to embrace. But just as Daniel\u2019s three friends knew, there is only One who is guaranteed to deliver\u2014because He already has and He always will.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932275\" id=\"p21\">For us on our journey back to the presence of God, to our promised land, it\u2019s not the politician, the musician, the athlete, or the vlogger that is the issue but, rather, choosing to allow them to become the primary objects of our attention and focus in place of our Savior and Redeemer.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932281\" id=\"p22\">We choose Him, Jesus Christ, when we choose to honor His day whether we\u2019re at home or traveling on vacation. We choose Him when we choose His words through the scriptures and the teachings of living prophets. We choose Him when we choose to hold a temple recommend and live worthy of its use. We choose Him when we are peacemakers and refuse to be contentious, \u201c<em>especially<\/em> when we have differences of opinion.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note15\"><sup class=\"marker\">15<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932287\" id=\"p23\">No leader has ever shown more courage, no humanitarian has shown more kindness, no physician has cured more disease, and no artist has been more creative than Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932293\" id=\"p24\">In a world of heroes, with monuments and museums devoted to the exploits of mortal men and women, there is One who stands above all others. I testify that Jesus Christ is not only our hero; He is our Lord and King, the Savior and Redeemer of mankind. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<footer class=\"notes\">\n<p class=\"title\" data-aid=\"156932299\" id=\"notetitle1\">Notes<\/p>\n<ol class=\"decimal\" data-type=\"marker\" start=\"1\">\n<li data-marker=\"1.\" id=\"note1\" data-full-marker=\"1.\">\n<p data-aid=\"156932305\" id=\"note1_p1\">Studies devoted to the Willie and Martin handcart companies include LeRoy R. and Ann W.
