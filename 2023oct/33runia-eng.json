One day, as we sat together reading a book, I looked at her with love but also sadness because, suddenly, she seemed more grown up. I thought, \u201cWhere has the time gone? She\u2019s so big!\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931934\" id=\"p2\">As I lifted my reading glasses to wipe away a tear, I realized, \u201cOh wait\u2014she\u2019s not bigger; it\u2019s just these glasses! Never mind!\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931939\" id=\"p3\">Sometimes all we can see is that up-close, magnified view of those we love. Tonight, I invite you to zoom out and look through a different lens\u2014an eternal lens that focuses on the big picture, your bigger story.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931947\" id=\"p4\">During humankind\u2019s early push into space, the unmanned rockets had no windows. But by the <i>Apollo 8<\/i> mission to the moon, the astronauts had one. While floating in space, they were struck by the power of seeing our earth and took this spectacular image, capturing the whole world\u2019s attention! Those astronauts experienced a sensation so powerful it has been given its own name: the overview effect.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"image no-print\" id=\"figure1\">\n<img alt=\"Earth as seen from space.\" id=\"img1\" src=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/9ad4208d5d8911eeb859eeeeac1ef72d2d784d71/full/500,/0/default\" data-img-id=\"9ad4208d5d8911eeb859eeeeac1ef72d2d784d71\" srcset=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/9ad4208d5d8911eeb859eeeeac1ef72d2d784d71/full/60,/0/default 60w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/9ad4208d5d8911eeb859eeeeac1ef72d2d784d71/full/100,/0/default 100w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/9ad4208d5d8911eeb859eeeeac1ef72d2d784d71/full/200,/0/default 200w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/9ad4208d5d8911eeb859eeeeac1ef72d2d784d71/full/250,/0/default 250w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/9ad4208d5d8911eeb859eeeeac1ef72d2d784d71/full/320,/0/default 320w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/9ad4208d5d8911eeb859eeeeac1ef72d2d784d71/full/500,/0/default 500w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/9ad4208d5d8911eeb859eeeeac1ef72d2d784d71/full/640,/0/default 640w\" data-assetId=\"9ad4208d5d8911eeb859eeeeac1ef72d2d784d71\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"323\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.5479876160990713\"/>\n<div class=\"credit\">\n<p data-aid=\"156931951\" id=\"figure1_p1\">NASA<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/figure>\n<p data-aid=\"156931956\" id=\"p5\">Viewing from a new vantage point changes <em>everything<\/em>. One space traveler said it \u201creduces things to a size that you think everything is manageable. \u2026 We can do this. Peace on earth\u2014no problem. It gives people that type of energy \u2026 that type of power.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\">1<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931961\" id=\"p6\">As humans, we have an earthbound point of view, but God sees the grand overview of the universe. He sees all creation, all of us, and is filled with hope.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931967\" id=\"p7\">Is it possible to begin to see as God sees even while living on the surface of this planet\u2014to feel this <em>overview<\/em> feeling? I believe we can, through the eye of faith, zoom out and view ourselves and our families with hope and joy.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931972\" id=\"p8\">The scriptures agree. Moroni speaks about those whose faith was so \u201cexceedingly strong\u201d that they \u201ctruly saw \u2026 with an eye of faith, <em>and they were glad<\/em>.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\">2<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931980\" id=\"p9\">With an eye focused on the Savior, they felt joy and knew this truth: because of Christ, it all works out. Everything <em>you<\/em> and <em>you<\/em> and <em>you<\/em> are worried about\u2014it\u2019s all going to be OK! And those who look with an eye of faith can <em>feel<\/em> that it\u2019s going to be OK <em>now<\/em>.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931987\" id=\"p10\">I went through a rough patch my senior year in high school when I wasn\u2019t making great choices. I remember seeing my mom crying, and I wondered if I\u2019d disappointed her. At the time, I worried that her tears meant she\u2019d lost hope for me, and if she didn\u2019t feel hope for me, maybe there wasn\u2019t a way back.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931994\" id=\"p11\">But my dad was more practiced at zooming out and taking the long view. He\u2019d learned from experience that worry feels a lot like love, but it\u2019s not the same.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\">3<\/sup><\/a> He used the eye of faith to see that everything would work out, and his hopeful approach changed me.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932001\" id=\"p12\">When I graduated from high school and went to BYU, my dad sent letters reminding me of who I was. He became my cheerleader, and everybody needs a cheerleader\u2014someone who isn\u2019t telling you, \u201cYou\u2019re not running fast enough\u201d; they\u2019re lovingly reminding you that you can.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932010\" id=\"p13\">Dad exemplified Lehi\u2019s dream. Like Lehi, he knew that you don\u2019t chase after your loved ones who feel lost. \u201cYou stay where you are and call them. You go to the tree, stay at the tree, keep eating the fruit and, with a smile on your face, continue to beckon to those you love and show by example that eating the fruit is a happy thing!\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\">4<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932015\" id=\"p14\">This visual image has helped me during low moments when I find myself at the tree, eating the fruit and crying because I\u2019m worried; and really, how helpful is that? Instead, let\u2019s choose hope\u2014hope in our Creator and in one another, fueling our ability to be better than we are right now.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932022\" id=\"p16\">Shortly after Elder Neal A. Maxwell passed away, a reporter asked his son what he\u2019d miss most. He said dinners at his parents\u2019 house because he always left feeling like his dad believed in him.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932032\" id=\"p17\">This was around the time our adult children were starting to come home for Sunday dinners with their spouses. During the week, I found myself making lists in my mind of things I could remind them of on Sunday, like \u201cMaybe try and help out more with the kids when you\u2019re home\u201d or \u201cDon\u2019t forget to be a good listener.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932039\" id=\"p19\">When I read Brother Maxwell\u2019s comment, I threw away the lists and silenced that critical voice, so when I saw my grown children for that brief time each week, I focused on the many positive things they were already doing. When our oldest son, Ryan, passed away a few years later, I remember being grateful our time together was happier and more positive.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932047\" id=\"p21\">Before we interact with a loved one, can we ask ourselves the question \u201cIs what I\u2019m about to do or say helpful or hurtful?\u201d Our words are one of our superpowers, and family members are like human blackboards, standing in front of us saying, \u201cWrite what you think of me!\u201d These messages, whether intentional or unintentional, should be hopeful and encouraging.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\">5<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932054\" id=\"p23\">Our job is not to teach someone who\u2019s going through a rough patch that they are bad or disappointing. On rare occasions we may feel prompted to correct, but most often let\u2019s tell our loved ones in spoken and unspoken ways the messages they long to hear: \u201cOur family feels whole and complete because you are in it.\u201d \u201cYou will be loved for the rest of your life\u2014no matter what.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932063\" id=\"p24\">Sometimes what we need is empathy more than advice; listening more than a lecture; someone who hears and wonders, \u201cHow would I have to feel to say what they just said?\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932071\" id=\"p25\">Remember, families are a God-given laboratory where we\u2019re figuring things out, so missteps and miscalculations are not just possible but probable. And wouldn\u2019t it be interesting if, at the end of our lives, we could see that those relationships, even those challenging moments, were the very things that helped us to become more like our Savior? Each difficult interaction is an opportunity to learn how to love at a deeper level\u2014a godlike level.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\">6<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932081\" id=\"p26\">Let\u2019s zoom out to view family relationships as a powerful vehicle to teach us the lessons we came here to learn as we turn to the Savior.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932089\" id=\"p27\">Let\u2019s admit, in a fallen world there\u2019s no way to be a perfect spouse, parent, son or daughter, grandchild, mentor, or friend\u2014but a million ways to be a good one.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\">7<\/sup><\/a> Let\u2019s stay at the tree, partake of the love of God, and share it. By lifting the people around us, we ascend together.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932097\" id=\"p28\">Unfortunately, the memory of eating the fruit is not enough; we need to partake again and again in ways that reposition our lens and connect us to the heavenly overview by opening up the scriptures, which are filled with light, to chase away the darkness, staying on our knees until our casual prayer turns mighty. This is when hearts soften, and we begin to see as God sees.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932106\" id=\"p29\">In these last days, perhaps our greatest work will be with our loved ones\u2014good people living in a wicked world. <em>Our<\/em> hope changes the way they see themselves and who they really are. And through this lens of love, they\u2019ll see who they <em>will<\/em> become.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932115\" id=\"p30\">But the adversary does not want us or our loved ones to return home together. And <em>because<\/em> we live on a planet that is bound by time and a finite number of years,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\">8<\/sup><\/a> he tries to perpetuate a very real sense of panic in us. It\u2019s hard to see, when we\u2019re zoomed in, that our direction matters more than our speed.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932123\" id=\"p31\">Remember, \u201cIf you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\">9<\/sup><\/a> Thankfully, the God we worship is <em>not<\/em> bound by time. He sees who our loved ones really are and who <em>we <\/em>really are.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\">10<\/sup><\/a> So He\u2019s patient with us, hoping we\u2019ll be patient with each other.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932131\" id=\"p32\">I will admit there are times when earth, our temporal home, feels like an island of sorrow\u2014moments when I have one eye of faith and the other eye is weeping.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\">11<\/sup><\/a> Do you know this feeling?<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932142\" id=\"p33\">I had it Tuesday.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932150\" id=\"p34\">Can we instead choose the faithful posture of our prophet when he promises miracles in our families? If we do, our joy will increase even if turbulence increases. He\u2019s promising that an overview effect can be experienced <em>now<\/em>, regardless of our circumstances.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\">12<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932161\" id=\"p35\">Having this eye of faith <em>now<\/em> is a recapturing, or an echo, of the faith we had before we came to this planet. It sees past the uncertainty of a moment, allowing us to \u201ccheerfully do all things that lie in our power; and then \u2026 stand still.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\">13<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932170\" id=\"p36\">Is there something difficult in your life right now, something you\u2019re worried can\u2019t be resolved? Without the eye of faith, that might feel like God has lost oversight of things, and is that true?<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932181\" id=\"p37\">Or maybe your greater fear is that you\u2019re going to go through this difficult time all by yourself, but that would mean God has abandoned you, and is that true?<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932191\" id=\"p38\">It is my witness that the Savior has the ability, because of His Atonement, to turn any nightmare you are going through into a blessing. He has given us a promise \u201cwith an immutable covenant\u201d that as we strive to love and follow Him, \u201c<em>all things<\/em> wherewith [we] have been afflicted shall work together for [our] good.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note14\"><sup class=\"marker\">14<\/sup><\/a> <em>All<\/em> things.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932200\" id=\"p40\">And because we are children of the covenant, we can ask for this hopeful feeling <em>now<\/em>!<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932209\" id=\"p41\">While our families aren\u2019t perfect, we can <em>perfect<\/em> our love for others until it becomes a constant, unchanging, no-matter-what kind of love\u2014the type of love that supports change and allows for growth and return.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932221\" id=\"p42\">It\u2019s the Savior\u2019s work to bring our loved ones back. It\u2019s <em>His<\/em> work and <em>His<\/em> timing. It is <em>our<\/em> work to provide the hope and a heart they can come home to. \u201cWe have neither [God\u2019s] authority to condemn nor His power to redeem, but we have been authorized to exercise His love.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note15\"><sup class=\"marker\">15<\/sup><\/a> President Nelson has also taught that others need our love more than our judgment. \u201cThey need to experience the pure love of Jesus Christ reflected in [our] words and actions.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note16\"><sup class=\"marker\">16<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932231\" id=\"p43\">Love is the thing that changes hearts. It is the purest motive of all, and others can feel it. Let\u2019s hold fast to these prophetic words offered 50 years ago: \u201cNo home is a failure unless it quits trying.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note17\"><sup class=\"marker\">17<\/sup><\/a> Surely, those who love the most and the longest win!<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932238\" id=\"p44\">In earthly families, we\u2019re simply doing what God has done with us\u2014pointing the way and hoping our loved ones will go in that direction, knowing the path they travel is theirs to choose.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932245\" id=\"p45\">And when they pass to the other side of the veil and draw close to that loving \u201cgravitational pull\u201d of their heavenly home,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note18\"><sup class=\"marker\">18<\/sup><\/a> I believe it will feel familiar because of how they were loved here.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932250\" id=\"p46\">Let\u2019s use that <em>overview lens<\/em> and see the people we love and live with as shared companions on this beautiful planet.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932255\" id=\"p47\">You and I? We can do this! We can hold on and hope on! We can stay at the tree and partake of the fruit with a smile on our face, letting the Light of Christ in our eyes become something others can count on in their darkest hours. As they see light manifest in our countenances, they will be drawn to it. We can then help refocus their attention to the original source of love and light, \u201cthe bright and morning star,\u201d Jesus Christ.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note19\"><sup class=\"marker\">19<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932262\" id=\"p48\">I bear my testimony that this\u2014all of this\u2014is going to turn out so much better than we could ever imagine! With an eye of faith on Jesus Christ, may we see that everything will be all right in the end and feel that it will be all right <em>now<\/em>.
