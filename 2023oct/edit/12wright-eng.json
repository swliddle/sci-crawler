After delivering a scathing rebuke of those who were like \u201cwhited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful outward, but are within full of dead men\u2019s bones, and of all uncleanness,\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\">1<\/sup><\/a> Jesus taught three more parables about spiritual preparedness and discipleship. One of these was the parable of the ten virgins.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931356\" id=\"p2\">\u201cThen shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins, which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931358\" id=\"p3\">\u201cAnd five of them were wise, and five were foolish.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931359\" id=\"p4\">\u201cThey that were foolish took their lamps, and took no oil with them:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931361\" id=\"p5\">\u201cBut the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931363\" id=\"p6\">\u201cWhile the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931366\" id=\"p7\">\u201cAnd at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931367\" id=\"p8\">\u201cThen all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931369\" id=\"p9\">\u201cAnd the foolish said unto the wise, Give us of your oil; for our lamps are gone out.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931371\" id=\"p10\">\u201cBut the wise answered, saying, Not so; lest there be not enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and buy for yourselves.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931372\" id=\"p11\">\u201cAnd while they went to buy, the bridegroom came; and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage: and the door was shut.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931374\" id=\"p12\">\u201cAfterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord, open to us.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\">2<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931375\" id=\"p13\">\u201cBut he answered and said, Verily I say unto you, Ye know me not.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\">3<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931377\" id=\"p14\">\u201cWatch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour wherein the Son of man cometh.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\">4<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931379\" id=\"p15\">President Dallin H. Oaks posed the following thought-provoking questions in relation to the coming of the Bridegroom:<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\">5<\/sup><\/a> \u201cWhat if the day of His coming were tomorrow? If we knew that we would meet the Lord tomorrow\u2014through our premature death or through His unexpected coming\u2014what would we do today?\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\">6<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931381\" id=\"p16\">I have learned from personal experience that spiritual preparation for the coming of the Lord is not only essential but the only way to find true peace and happiness.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931383\" id=\"p17\">It was a crisp fall day when I first heard the words \u201cYou have cancer.\u201d My husband and I were stunned! As we drove home in silence, processing the news, my heart turned to our three sons.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931386\" id=\"p18\">In my mind I asked Heavenly Father, \u201cAm I going to die?\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931388\" id=\"p48\">The Holy Ghost whispered, \u201cEverything is going to be OK.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931389\" id=\"p49\">Then I asked, \u201cAm I going to live?\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931391\" id=\"p50\">Again, the answer came: \u201cEverything is going to be OK.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931393\" id=\"p51\">I was confused. Why did I receive the exact same answer whether I lived or died?<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931396\" id=\"p19\">Then suddenly every fiber of my being filled with absolute peace as I was reminded: We did not need to hurry home and teach our children how to pray. They knew how to receive answers and comfort from prayer. We did not need to hurry home and teach them about the scriptures or words of living prophets. Those words were already a familiar source of strength and understanding. We did not need to hurry home and teach them about repentance, the Resurrection, the Restoration, the plan of salvation, eternal families, or the very doctrine of Jesus Christ.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931398\" id=\"p20\">In that moment every family home evening lesson, scripture study session, prayer of faith offered, blessing given, testimony shared, covenant made and kept, house of the Lord attended, and Sabbath day observed mattered\u2014oh, how it mattered! It was too late to put oil in our lamps. We needed every single drop, and we needed it right now!<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931401\" id=\"p21\">Because of Jesus Christ and His restored gospel, if I died, my family would be comforted, strengthened, and one day restored. If I lived, I would have access to the greatest power on this earth to help succor, sustain, and heal me.
