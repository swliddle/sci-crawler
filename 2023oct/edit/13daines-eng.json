He was fortunate to be alive\u2014he\u2019d been shot just behind the ear, but doctors had operated, and he could now walk and talk normally.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156930565\" id=\"p2\">Tragically, the bullet had damaged the part of his brain that recognized faces. He now looked at his wife without a spark of recognition; he couldn\u2019t recognize his own mother. Even the face in the mirror was foreign to him\u2014he couldn\u2019t tell if it was a man or a woman.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\">1<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156930566\" id=\"p3\">He\u2019d become face-blind\u2014a condition that affects millions of people.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\">2<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156930567\" id=\"p4\">People who are severely face-blind try to identify others by memorizing rules\u2014a rule for recognizing a daughter by the pattern of her freckles or a friend by her shuffling gait.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"156930569\" id=\"title3\">Growing Up<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"156930571\" id=\"p5\">Here\u2019s a second story, closer to home: As a young boy, I often saw my mom as the rule maker. She decided when I could play and when I had to go to bed or, worse, pull weeds in the yard.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156930573\" id=\"p6\">She obviously loved me. But too often and to my shame, I saw her only as \u201cShe Who Must Be Obeyed.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156930575\" id=\"p7\">Only years later did I come to see her as a real person. I am embarrassed that I never really noticed her sacrifice or wondered why for years she only ever wore the same two old skirts (while I got new school clothes) or why, at the end of the day, she was so tired and eager for me to go to bed early.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"156930576\" id=\"title4\">We May Be Face-Blind<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"156930578\" id=\"p8\">Perhaps you\u2019ve noticed that these two stories are really one story\u2014for too many years, I was, in effect, face-blind. I failed to see my mom as a real person. I saw her rules but didn\u2019t see in them her love.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156930581\" id=\"p9\">I tell you these two stories to make one point: I suspect you know someone (perhaps you <em>are<\/em> someone) who suffers from a kind of spiritual face blindness.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156930583\" id=\"p10\">You may struggle to see God as a loving Father. You may look heavenward and see not the face of love and mercy but a thicket of rules through which you must wend your way. Perhaps you believe God rules in His heavens, speaks through His prophets, and loves your sister, but you secretly wonder whether He loves you.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\">3<\/sup><\/a> Perhaps you have felt the iron rod in your hand but not yet felt your Savior\u2019s love to which it leads.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\">4<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156930584\" id=\"p11\">I suspect you know people like this because for a long time, I <em>was<\/em> someone like this\u2014I was spiritually face-blind.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156930586\" id=\"p12\">I thought my life was about following rules and measuring up to abstract standards. I knew God loved <em>you<\/em> perfectly but didn\u2019t feel it myself. I\u2019m afraid I thought more about getting into heaven than being with my Heavenly Father.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156930589\" id=\"p13\">If you, like me, can sometimes only lip-synch but not \u201csing the song of redeeming love,\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\">5<\/sup><\/a> what can we do?<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156930590\" id=\"p14\">The answer, as President Russell M.

It tells of a group of outsiders who make their way to a disciple with an important request. \u201cSir,\u201d they say, \u201cwe would [like to] see Jesus.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\">7<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156930596\" id=\"p17\">That is what we all want\u2014we want to see Jesus for who He is and to feel His love. This should be the reason for most of what we do in the Church\u2014and certainly of every sacrament meeting. If you\u2019re ever wondering what kind of lesson to teach, what kind of meeting to plan, and whether to just give up on the deacons and play dodgeball, you might take this verse as your guide: will this help people see and love Jesus Christ? If not, maybe try something else.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156930598\" id=\"p19\">When I realized that I was spiritually face-blind, that I saw rules but not the face of the Father\u2019s mercy, I knew it wasn\u2019t the Church\u2019s fault.

Even the early witnesses to the Resurrection often came face-to-face with the resurrected Lord but did not recognize Him; from the Garden Tomb to the shores of Galilee, His first followers \u201csaw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\">8<\/sup><\/a> They had to learn to recognize Him, and so do we.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\">9<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"156930600\" id=\"title6\">Charity<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"156930603\" id=\"p20\">When I realized I was spiritually face-blind, I started to follow Mormon\u2019s counsel to pray \u201cwith all the energy of heart\u201d to be filled with the love promised His disciples\u2014my love for Him and His love for me\u2014and to \u201csee him as he is \u2026 and have this hope.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\">10<\/sup><\/a> I prayed for years to be able to follow the first great commandment to love God and to feel that \u201cfirst great <em>truth<\/em> \u2026 that God loves <em>us<\/em> with all of <em>His<\/em> heart, might, mind, and strength.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\">11<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"156930605\" id=\"title7\">The Gospels<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"156930606\" id=\"p21\">I also read and reread and reread the four Gospels\u2014this time reading not to extract rules but to see who He is and what He loves.
