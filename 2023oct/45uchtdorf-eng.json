One son<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\">4<\/sup><\/a> tells his father he is through with life at home. He wants his freedom. He wants to leave behind the culture and teachings of his parents. He asks for his share of the inheritance\u2014now.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\">5<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932073\" id=\"p4\">Can you imagine what the father felt when he heard this? When he realized that what his son wanted more than anything else was to leave the family and perhaps never return?<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"156932080\" id=\"title3\">The Great Adventure<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"156932088\" id=\"p5\">The son must have felt a thrill of adventure and excitement. At long last, he was on his own. Free from the principles and rules of the culture of his youth, he could finally make his own choices without being influenced by his parents. No more guilt. He could bask in the acceptance of a like-minded community and live life on his own terms.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932095\" id=\"p6\">Arriving in a faraway country, he quickly made new friends and began living the life he had always dreamed of. He must have been a favorite of many, for he spent money freely. His new friends\u2014beneficiaries of his prodigality\u2014did not judge him. They celebrated, applauded, and championed his choices.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\">6<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932102\" id=\"p7\">Had there been social media in that time, surely he would have filled pages with animated photos of laughing friends: #Livingmybestlife! #Neverhappier! #Shouldhavedonethislongago!<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"156932110\" id=\"title4\">The Famine<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"156932117\" id=\"p8\">But the party did not last\u2014it rarely does. Two things happened: first, he ran out of money, and second, a famine swept through the land.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\">7<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932126\" id=\"p9\">As the problems worsened, he panicked. The once unstoppable, jubilant high roller now could not afford a single meal, let alone a place to stay. How would he survive?<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932133\" id=\"p10\">He had been generous to his friends\u2014would they help him now? I can see him asking for a little support\u2014just for now\u2014until he got back on his feet.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932144\" id=\"p11\">The scriptures tell us, \u201cNo man gave unto him.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\">8<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932153\" id=\"p12\">Desperate to remain alive, he found a local farmer who hired him to feed swine.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\">9<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932164\" id=\"p13\">Extremely hungry now, abandoned and alone, the young man must have wondered how things could have gone so terribly, dreadfully wrong.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932173\" id=\"p14\">It wasn\u2019t just an empty stomach that troubled him. It was an empty soul. He had been so sure that giving in to his worldly desires would make him happy, that moral laws were obstacles to that happiness. Now he knew better. And oh, what a price he had to pay for that knowledge!<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\">10<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932183\" id=\"p15\">As the physical and spiritual hunger grew, his thoughts returned to his father. Would he help him after all that had happened?
