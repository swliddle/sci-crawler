Sadly, every nearby food business had been destroyed by looters, but to my great astonishment, our bakery was intact. Nothing had been destroyed. I humbly thanked my Heavenly Father.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931558\" id=\"p8\">\u201cArriving home, I told my family of God\u2019s blessing and protection.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931564\" id=\"p9\">\u201cThey were all so grateful.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931570\" id=\"p10\">\u201cMy oldest son, Rogelio, only 12 years old, said, \u2018Papa!

In 1998 I accompanied then-Elder Henry B. Eyring to a large Church meeting in the Utah area now known as Silicon Slopes, a community of great innovation in technology. It was a time of growing prosperity, and Elder Eyring cautioned the Saints about comparing what they had with others and wanting more. I will always remember his promise that as they paid an honest tithe, their desire for more material possessions would diminish. Within two years, the technology bubble burst. Many lost their jobs, and companies struggled during this time of financial adjustment. Those who followed the counsel of Elder Eyring were blessed.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156931721\" id=\"p31\">His promise reminded me of another experience. I met 12-year-old Charlotte Hlimi near Carcassonne, France, in 1990 while serving as a mission president. The Hlimis were a faithful family living in an apartment with eight children. They had a picture of the Savior and of the prophet on the wall. In the interview for her patriarchal blessing, I asked Charlotte if she paid an honest tithe. She responded, \u201cYes, President Andersen. My mother has taught me that there are temporal blessings and spiritual blessings that come from paying our tithing. My mother taught me that if we always pay our tithing, we will want for nothing. And President Andersen, we want for nothing.\u201d<\/p>\n<img alt=\"Hlimi family. \" id=\"img2\" src=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/87de757e5d8911ee8a97eeeeac1e25103820e4e4/full/500,/0/default\" data-img-id=\"87de757e5d8911ee8a97eeeeac1e25103820e4e4\" srcset=\"https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/87de757e5d8911ee8a97eeeeac1e25103820e4e4/full/60,/0/default 60w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/87de757e5d8911ee8a97eeeeac1e25103820e4e4/full/100,/0/default 100w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/87de757e5d8911ee8a97eeeeac1e25103820e4e4/full/200,/0/default 200w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/87de757e5d8911ee8a97eeeeac1e25103820e4e4/full/250,/0/default 250w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/87de757e5d8911ee8a97eeeeac1e25103820e4e4/full/320,/0/default 320w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/87de757e5d8911ee8a97eeeeac1e25103820e4e4/full/500,/0/default 500w,https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/imgs/87de757e5d8911ee8a97eeeeac1e25103820e4e4/full/640,/0/default 640w\" data-assetId=\"87de757e5d8911ee8a97eeeeac1e25103820e4e4\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"323\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.5479876160990713\"/>\n<p data-aid=\"156931728\" id=\"p38\">In giving me permission to share her story, Charlotte, now 45 and sealed in the temple, commented: \u201cMy testimony of tithing was very real at the time, and it is even stronger now.

Twenty-five years ago, just days before my mother-in-law, Martha Williams, died of cancer, she received a small check in the mail. She immediately asked my wife, Kathy, for her checkbook to pay her tithing. As her mother was so weakened that she could scarcely write, Kathy asked if she could write the check for her. Her mother responded, \u201cNo, Kathy. I want to do it myself.\u201d And then she quietly added, \u201cI want to be right before the Lord.\u201d One of the final things Kathy did for her mother was to hand her tithing envelope to her bishop.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"156931742\" id=\"p33\">God\u2019s Important Work<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"156931751\" id=\"p44\">My brothers and sisters, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is \u201cout of obscurity,\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note26\"><sup class=\"marker\">26<\/sup><\/a> bringing remarkable blessings across the earth.

Oaks shared this story about trusting in the Lord: \u201cMy widowed mother supported her three young children on a [meager] salary. \u2026 I asked my mother why she paid so much of her salary as tithing. I have never forgotten her explanation: \u2018Dallin, there might be some people who can get along without paying tithing, but we can\u2019t. The Lord has chosen to take your father and leave me to raise you children. I cannot do that without the blessings of the Lord, and I obtain those blessings by paying an honest tithing\u2019\u201d (\u201c<a class=\"cross-ref\" href=\"/study/general-conference/1994/04/tithing?lang=eng&amp;para=16#p16\">Tithing<\/a>,\u201d 33).<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"24.\" id=\"note24\" data-full-marker=\"24.\">\n<p data-aid=\"156932989\" id=\"note24_p1\">\u201cThat through my providence, notwithstanding the tribulation which shall descend upon you, that the church may stand independent above all other creatures beneath the celestial world\u201d (<a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/78.14?lang=eng#p14\">Doctrine and Covenants 78:14<\/a>).<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"25.\" id=\"note25\" data-full-marker=\"25.\">\n<p data-aid=\"156932999\" id=\"note25_p1\">Personal correspondence from Charlotte Hlimi Martin, Aug. 30, 2023.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"26.\" id=\"note26\" data-full-marker=\"26.\">\n<p data-aid=\"156933008\" id=\"note26_p1\"><a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/1.30?lang=eng#p30\">Doctrine and Covenants 1:30<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"27.\" id=\"note27\" data-full-marker=\"27.\">\n<p data-aid=\"156933017\" id=\"note27_p1\"><a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/nt/acts/5.38-39?lang=eng#p38\">Acts 5:38\u201339<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"28.\" id=\"note28\" data-full-marker=\"28.\">\n<p data-aid=\"156933025\" id=\"note28_p1\">Russell M.

The logic of man does not always align with the wisdom of God. In Malachi\u2019s day, many had become distant from the Lord. The Lord implored His covenant people, \u201cReturn unto me, and I will return unto you.\u201d What follows this tender invitation is a deeply important question for each of us: \u201cBut ye said, Wherein shall we return?\u201d (<a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/ot/mal/3.7?lang=eng#p7\">Malachi 3:7<\/a>). Or in other words, \u201cWhat am I to change? How do I draw closer to Thee?\u201d The Lord answers by teaching the importance of tithing, not simply as a financial law but a tangible way to turn the desires of our hearts to Him.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"156932864\" id=\"note8_p2\">We observed this in our own family. Kathy\u2019s mother joined the Church at age 22. Martha and Bernard Williams attended church for a brief period, but after a move to another state, they became less active. Bernard received a military deployment overseas, and Martha moved home to Tampa, Florida, where she accepted the generous invitation to live with her aunt and uncle, who were opposed to the Church. While living in very humble circumstances, expecting her first child and not attending church, Martha Williams made the decision to start sending her tithing check to the bishop. Later in her life, when asked why, she said that she remembered something the missionaries had taught her about tithing and God\u2019s blessings: \u201cWe desperately needed God\u2019s blessings in our lives, and so I began sending our tithing check to the bishop.\u201d Martha and Bernard Williams returned to the Church. Their greatest blessing\u2014six generations have been blessed because of her decision to pay her tithing when she had nothing but faith in God and hope in His promises.<\/p>",

I have never forgotten her explanation: \u2018Dallin, there might be some people who can get along without paying tithing, but we can\u2019t. The Lord has chosen to take your father and leave me to raise you children.
