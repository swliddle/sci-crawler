One day after school, I asked, \u201cMom, what should I be when I grow up: a professional basketball player or a rock star?\u201d Unfortunately, Clark \u201cthe toothless wonder\u201d showed no signs of future athletic or musical glory. And despite multiple efforts, I was repeatedly denied admission to my school\u2019s advanced academic program. My teachers finally suggested I should just stick to the standard classroom. Over time, I developed compensating study habits. But it wasn\u2019t until my mission to Japan that I felt my intellectual and spiritual possibilities begin to emerge. I continued to work hard. But for the first time in my life, I systematically involved the Lord in my development, and it made all the difference.<\/p>\n<img id=\"img1\" src=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/77/13/7713c351cd66cb8da570392dbf15fcdef61e7ea2/clark_g_gilbert_childhood.png\" data-img-id=\"574434e922f911ecb34aeeeeac1e8d8a5eb85ef3\" srcset=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/0d/d9/0dd9449866b7f592ee940105128c0f5e52df9706/clark_g_gilbert_childhood.png 60w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/79/ac/79ac73bfd39eadef25b05b63ff7f1695612fd876/clark_g_gilbert_childhood.png 100w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/85/8e/858efe91d22108ab56a913fb504494f07377ab8e/clark_g_gilbert_childhood.png 200w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/19/fb/19fbc1d4fe70cfb29261990db56d60d5e0ec775d/clark_g_gilbert_childhood.png 250w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/03/08/0308da9590896b0563fb88e41c825960ec3a0dc9/clark_g_gilbert_childhood.png 320w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/77/13/7713c351cd66cb8da570392dbf15fcdef61e7ea2/clark_g_gilbert_childhood.png 500w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/a0/a8/a0a836dfb610d636623749a4095c0935809ae856/clark_g_gilbert_childhood.png 640w\" data-assetId=\"574434e922f911ecb34aeeeeac1e8d8a5eb85ef3\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"323\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.5479876160990713\" alt=\"Clark G.

In the Lord\u2019s timing, it is not where we start but where we are headed that matters most.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\">1<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147978345\" id=\"p3\">To demonstrate this principle, I will draw on some basic math. Now, don\u2019t panic at hearing the word <em>math<\/em> in general conference. Our BYU\u2013Idaho math faculty assure me that even the beginner will grasp this central concept. It starts with the formula for a line. The intercept, for our purposes, is the beginning of our line. The intercept can have either a high or a low starting point. The slope of the line can then be positively or negatively inclined.<\/p>\n<img id=\"img7\" src=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/bd/b0/bdb0a365c01a8d2ae912f16b12574dfc4d9d94b8/spiritual_focus.png\" data-img-id=\"d01695b32ac711ec9f65eeeeac1ecd5a819e9bff\" srcset=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/71/e8/71e82c4f3514a1fa34402ccb1fc613e944994d26/spiritual_focus.png 60w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/96/d5/96d55cab2c5188a8569e1d5a70192d1e01292ed0/spiritual_focus.png 100w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/31/16/311622e34d31f92c574def0e023dda2764132553/spiritual_focus.png 200w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/c8/a4/c8a4cfa7c6bd3890187d298a137dbd8109cfbacd/spiritual_focus.png 250w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/30/ae/30ae6a39757470d933e6a2b6bb36176b26d13360/spiritual_focus.png 320w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/bd/b0/bdb0a365c01a8d2ae912f16b12574dfc4d9d94b8/spiritual_focus.png 500w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/24/24/24247a0e065e3c8e9ed2b7933e9c3444f3cbe948/spiritual_focus.png 640w\" data-assetId=\"d01695b32ac711ec9f65eeeeac1ecd5a819e9bff\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"323\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.5479876160990713\" alt=\"Spiritual Focus\"/>\n<p data-aid=\"147978349\" id=\"p4\">We all have different intercepts in life\u2014we start in different places with different life endowments. Some are born with high intercepts, full of opportunity. Others face beginning circumstances that are challenging and seem unfair.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\">2<\/sup><\/a> We then progress along a slope of personal progress. Our future will be determined far less by our starting point and much more by our slope. Jesus Christ sees divine potential no matter where we start. He saw it in the beggar, the sinner, and the infirm. He saw it in the fisherman, the tax collector, and even the zealot. No matter where we start, Christ considers what we do with what we are given.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\">3<\/sup><\/a> While the world focuses on our intercept, God focuses on our slope. In the Lord\u2019s calculus, He will do everything He can to help us turn our slopes toward heaven.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147978352\" id=\"p5\">This principle should give comfort to those who struggle, and <em>pause<\/em> to those who seem to have every advantage. Let me start by addressing individuals with difficult starting circumstances, including poverty, limited access to education, and challenging family situations. Others face physical challenges, mental health constraints, or strong genetic predispositions.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\">4<\/sup><\/a> For any struggling with difficult starting points, please recognize that the Savior knows our struggles. He took \u201cupon him [our] infirmities, that his bowels [might] be filled with mercy, \u2026 that he [might] know \u2026 how to succor [us] according to [our] infirmities.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\">5<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147978356\" id=\"p6\">Let me share two areas of encouragement for those facing difficult starting circumstances. First, focus on where you are headed and not where you began. It would be wrong to ignore your circumstances\u2014they are real and need to be addressed. But overfocusing on a difficult starting point can cause it to define you and even <em>constrain<\/em> your ability to choose.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\">6<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<img id=\"img3\" src=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/f4/0a/f40a5d0d23e1d7f307640667e61f661cf0fc3358/the_boston_boys.png\" data-img-id=\"5677e43822f911ecb34aeeeeac1e8d8a5f8c5d1b\" srcset=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/a8/51/a85154ba1fc6e1d903732016c1364aa52e22c258/the_boston_boys.png 60w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/45/3e/453e8369d6b2cb7b43f0e07676868c126bc71372/the_boston_boys.png 100w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/31/1e/311e03928971554701120d0996ed354f3ea50f4e/the_boston_boys.png 200w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/92/41/924183e18948fab18d4da87e0dcf119aa44d8a75/the_boston_boys.png 250w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/71/b2/71b293db333e004cf169f0e8f03d1d8a28794a86/the_boston_boys.png 320w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/f4/0a/f40a5d0d23e1d7f307640667e61f661cf0fc3358/the_boston_boys.png 500w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/a4/d2/a4d28bef672c00c5d7ae698bcec623dffe98bdfa/the_boston_boys.png 640w\" data-assetId=\"5677e43822f911ecb34aeeeeac1e8d8a5f8c5d1b\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"323\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.5479876160990713\" alt=\"The Boston Boys\"/>\n<p data-aid=\"147978360\" id=\"p7\">Years ago I served with a group of inner-city youth in Boston, Massachusetts, who were largely new to the gospel and to the expectations of the Church. It was tempting to confuse my empathy and concern for their situation with a desire to lower God\u2019s standards.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\">7<\/sup><\/a> I eventually realized that the most powerful way to show my love was to never lower my expectations. With everything I knew to do, we focused together on their potential, and each of them began to elevate their slopes. Their growth in the gospel was gradual but steady. Today they have served missions, have graduated from college, have been married in the temple, and are leading remarkable personal and professional lives.<\/p>\n<img id=\"img4\" src=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/b3/8d/b38d40b649ea359c7da68ef50cc3e82835f716f2/the_boston_boys.png\" data-img-id=\"59f17ab522f911ecbd09eeeeac1ec23d6efad7cb\" srcset=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/35/39/3539b1fa2f1cce56e22ecea1a6706e3b20c7ddc6/the_boston_boys.png 60w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/b8/16/b816ed9eb496115210e9dc02465b2adf6941c77c/the_boston_boys.png 100w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/38/06/38065c88b7ae51121189dda6a23e9f28e8386e1d/the_boston_boys.png 200w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/c9/42/c94232e65f515829a73d8d99369f9bab1624be7f/the_boston_boys.png 250w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/23/a6/23a67c9370b8feb1e572082f7df7072aa5de74f5/the_boston_boys.png 320w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/b3/8d/b38d40b649ea359c7da68ef50cc3e82835f716f2/the_boston_boys.png 500w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/a2/0f/a20f1e507af9112043c70da7c01d37893ecd2bdd/the_boston_boys.png 640w\" data-assetId=\"59f17ab522f911ecbd09eeeeac1ec23d6efad7cb\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"323\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.5479876160990713\" alt=\"The Boston Boys\"/>\n<p data-aid=\"147978365\" id=\"p8\">Second, involve the Lord in the process of lifting your slope. While serving as the president of BYU\u2013Pathway Worldwide, I remember sitting in a large devotional in Lima, Peru, where Elder Carlos A. Godoy was the speaker.

Godoy,\"/>\n<p data-aid=\"147978368\" id=\"p9\">Finally, let me share two areas of counsel for those with elevated starting points. First, can we show some humility for circumstances we may not have created ourselves? As former BYU president Rex E. Lee quoted to his students, \u201cWe have all drunk from wells we did not dig, and warmed ourselves by fires we did not build.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\">12<\/sup><\/a> He then called on his students to give back and replenish the educational wells that earlier pioneers had built. Failure to reseed the fields planted by others can be the equivalent of returning a talent without increase.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147978372\" id=\"p10\">Second, focusing on a high starting point can often trap us into feeling that we are thriving when in fact our inner slope may be quite stagnant. Harvard professor Clayton M. Christensen taught that the most successful people are the humblest because they are confident enough to be corrected by and learn from anyone.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\">13<\/sup><\/a> Elder D. Todd Christofferson counseled us to \u201cwillingly [find ways] to accept and even seek correction.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note14\"><sup class=\"marker\">14<\/sup><\/a> Even when things appear to be going well, we must seek out opportunities to improve through prayerful petition.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147978379\" id=\"p11\">Regardless of whether we start in abundant or difficult circumstances, we will realize our ultimate potential only when we make God our partner. I recently had a conversation with a nationally prominent educator who was inquiring about the success of BYU\u2013Pathway. He was bright and his inquiry was sincere, but he clearly wanted a secular response. I shared with him our retention programs and mentoring efforts. But I concluded by saying, \u201cThese are all good practices, but the real reason our students are progressing is because we teach them their divine potential. Imagine if your whole life, you were told you could never succeed. Then consider the impact of being taught that you are an actual son or daughter of God with divine possibility.\u201d He paused, then replied simply, \u201cThat\u2019s powerful.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147978381\" id=\"p12\">Brothers and sisters, one of the miracles of this, the Lord\u2019s Church, is that each of us can become something more in Christ. I know of no other organization that gives its members more opportunities to serve, give back, repent, and become better people. Whether we start in abundant or difficult circumstances, let us keep our sights and our slopes pointed heavenward. As we do, Christ will lift us to a higher place. In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<footer class=\"notes\">\n<p class=\"title\" data-aid=\"147978384\" id=\"note_title1\">Notes<\/p>\n<ol class=\"decimal\" data-type=\"marker\" start=\"1\">\n<li data-marker=\"1.\" id=\"note1\" data-full-marker=\"1.\">\n<p data-aid=\"147978388\" id=\"note1_p1\">See Clark G.

This message was originally given as a Class Day address tied to Harvard Business School graduation. In his message, Professor Christensen cautioned his students not to decouple confidence from humility, reminding them that to continue to progress throughout life, they would need to be humble enough to seek correction and learn from others.<\/p>"

In this message I explored how the world often mismeasures human potential. Even well-meaning individuals who draw on the important work of leading psychologists who advocate concepts of grit (Angela Duckworth) and growth mindset (Carol S. Dweck) underestimate real human capacity when they rely only on learned patterns and ignore our divine potential in Christ.<\/p>",
