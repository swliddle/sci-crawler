As part of the assignment, I was able to visit Liberty Jail in Missouri. As I viewed the jail, I contemplated the events that make it such a significant part of Church history. The lives of the Saints were threatened as the result of an extermination order issued by the governor of Missouri. In addition, the Prophet Joseph and a few choice associates had been unjustly imprisoned in Liberty Jail. One of the reasons for the violent opposition to our members was most of them were opposed to slavery.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\">1<\/sup><\/a> This intense persecution of Joseph Smith and his followers constitutes an extreme example of the unrighteous exercise of agency that can impact righteous people. Joseph\u2019s time in Liberty Jail demonstrates that adversity is not evidence of the Lord\u2019s disfavor nor a withdrawal of His blessings.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979899\" id=\"p2\">I was deeply moved as I read what the Prophet Joseph Smith declared as he was confined in Liberty Jail: \u201cO God, where art thou? And where is the pavilion that covereth thy hiding place?\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\">2<\/sup><\/a> Joseph inquired how long the Lord\u2019s people would \u201csuffer these wrongs and unlawful oppressions.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\">3<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<img id=\"img1\" src=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/d3/11/d311e81a023905a49e92887cd5ec7bd27f5b8f9a/quentin_l_cook_liberty_jail.png\" data-img-id=\"c5cab849231a11eca865eeeeac1e3df9ba6c8c87\" srcset=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/55/91/559193074990a7272735ddc3dc820fb5738dd4f7/quentin_l_cook_liberty_jail.png 60w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/f6/58/f6586d594d4b3256eaa979e4bfe70af2abfecc1a/quentin_l_cook_liberty_jail.png 100w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/e6/a3/e6a363d8b8512e110837112d5b4c9e3e273fb922/quentin_l_cook_liberty_jail.png 200w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/cd/01/cd0149423c8946d5415362de564dcb60f2d1ca2a/quentin_l_cook_liberty_jail.png 250w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/17/81/17810e925ca032c328631905c1c2e9d46d4c18f5/quentin_l_cook_liberty_jail.png 320w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/d3/11/d311e81a023905a49e92887cd5ec7bd27f5b8f9a/quentin_l_cook_liberty_jail.png 500w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/c1/6b/c16bf8cfb239d211f619247eb6676c3e1f6310be/quentin_l_cook_liberty_jail.png 640w\" data-assetId=\"c5cab849231a11eca865eeeeac1e3df9ba6c8c87\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"323\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.5479876160990713\" alt=\"Quentin L. Cook\"/>\n<p data-aid=\"147979904\" id=\"p3\">As I stood in Liberty Jail, I was deeply touched as I read the Lord\u2019s answer: \u201cMy son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment; and then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\">4<\/sup><\/a> It is clear that opposition can refine us for an eternal, celestial destiny.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\">5<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979909\" id=\"p4\">The Savior\u2019s precious words \u201cMy son, peace be unto thy soul\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\">6<\/sup><\/a> resonate with me personally and have great significance for our day. They remind me of His teachings to His disciples during His mortal ministry.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979914\" id=\"p5\">Prior to Christ\u2019s suffering in the Garden of Gethsemane and on the cross, He commanded His Apostles to \u201clove one another; as I have loved you\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\">7<\/sup><\/a> and subsequently comforted them with these words: \u201cPeace I leave with you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto you. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\">8<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979919\" id=\"p6\">One of the most cherished titles of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, is \u201cPrince of Peace.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\">9<\/sup><\/a> Ultimately His kingdom will be established including peace and love.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\">10<\/sup><\/a> We look forward to the millennial reign of the Messiah.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979923\" id=\"p7\">Notwithstanding this vision of the millennial reign, we know that world peace and harmony are not prevalent in our day.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\">11<\/sup><\/a> In my lifetime, I have never seen a greater lack of civility. We are bombarded with angry, contentious language and provocative, devastating actions that destroy peace and tranquility.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979927\" id=\"p8\">Peace in the world is not promised or assured until the Second Coming of Jesus Christ. The Savior instructed His Apostles that His earthly mission would not achieve universal peace. He taught, \u201cThink not that I am come to send peace on earth.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\">12<\/sup><\/a> Universal peace was not part of the Savior\u2019s initial mortal ministry. Universal peace does not exist today.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979931\" id=\"p9\">However, <em>personal<\/em> peace can be achieved despite the anger, contention, and division that blight and corrupt our world today. It has never been more important to seek personal peace. A beautiful and beloved new hymn, written for today\u2019s youth by Brother Nik Day, titled \u201cPeace in Christ\u201d declares, \u201cWhen there\u2019s no peace on earth, there is peace in Christ.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\">13<\/sup><\/a> We were blessed to have this hymn just before the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979935\" id=\"p10\">This hymn reflects in a beautiful fashion the aspiration for peace and appropriately emphasizes that peace is anchored in the life and mission of Jesus Christ. President JosephÂ F. Smith declared, \u201cThere never can come to the world that spirit of peace and love \u2026 until mankind will receive God\u2019s truth and God\u2019s message \u2026 and acknowledge his power and authority which is divine.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note14\"><sup class=\"marker\">14<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979939\" id=\"p11\">While we will never retreat from efforts to achieve universal peace, we have been assured that we can have personal peace, as Christ teaches. This principle is set forth in the Doctrine and Covenants: \u201cBut learn that he who doeth the works of righteousness shall receive his reward, even peace in this world, and eternal life in the world to come.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note15\"><sup class=\"marker\">15<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979945\" id=\"p12\">What are some of the \u201cworks of righteousness\u201d that will help us deal with disputations and lessen contention and find peace in this world? All of Christ\u2019s teachings point in this direction. I will mention a few which I believe are particularly important.<\/p>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"147979950\" id=\"title2\">First: Love God, Live His Commandments, and Forgive Everyone<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"147979956\" id=\"p13\">President George Albert Smith became President of the Church in 1945. He had been known during his years as an Apostle as a peace-loving leader. In the preceding 15 years before he became President, the challenges and trials of a massive worldwide depression, followed by the death and destruction of World WarÂ II, had been anything but peaceful.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979962\" id=\"p14\">At the conclusion of World WarÂ II, during his first general conference as President in October 1945, President Smith reminded the Saints of the Savior\u2019s invitation to love their neighbors and forgive their enemies and then taught, \u201cThat is the spirit all Latter-day Saints should seek to possess if they hope some day to stand in his presence and receive at his hands a glorious welcome home.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note16\"><sup class=\"marker\">16<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"147979968\" id=\"title3\">Second: Seek the Fruits of the Spirit<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"147979974\" id=\"p15\">The Apostle Paul, in his Epistle to the Galatians, sets forth the dichotomy between works of righteousness that qualify us to inherit the kingdom of God and works that can, without repentance, disqualify us. Among those that qualify us are the fruits of the Spirit: \u201clove, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, [and] temperance.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note17\"><sup class=\"marker\">17<\/sup><\/a> Paul also includes bearing one another\u2019s burdens and being not weary in well-doing.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note18\"><sup class=\"marker\">18<\/sup><\/a> Among those works that are not righteous he includes hatred, wrath, and <em>strife<\/em>.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note19\"><sup class=\"marker\">19<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979980\" id=\"p16\">One of the great lessons in the Old Testament period relates to Father Abraham. Abraham and Lot, his nephew, were wealthy but found they could not dwell together. To eliminate strife, Abraham allowed Lot to choose the land he wanted. Lot chose the plain of Jordan, which was both well watered and beautiful. Abraham took the less fertile plain of Mamre. The scriptures read that Abraham then pitched his tent and built \u201can altar unto the Lord.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note20\"><sup class=\"marker\">20<\/sup><\/a> Lot, on the other hand, \u201cpitched his tent toward Sodom.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note21\"><sup class=\"marker\">21<\/sup><\/a> To have peaceful relationships, the lesson is clear: we should be willing to compromise and eliminate strife with respect to matters that do not involve righteousness. As King Benjamin taught, \u201cYe will not have a mind to injure one another, but to live peaceably.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note22\"><sup class=\"marker\">22<\/sup><\/a> But on conduct relating to righteousness and doctrinal imperatives, we need to remain firm and steadfast.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979986\" id=\"p17\">If we want to have the peace which is the reward of the works of righteousness, we will <em>not<\/em> pitch our tents toward the world. We will pitch our tents toward the temple.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"147979992\" id=\"title4\">Third: Exercise Agency to Choose Righteousness<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"147979997\" id=\"p18\">Peace and agency are intertwined as essential elements of the plan of salvation. As described in the Gospel Topics article \u201cAgency and Accountability,\u201d \u201cAgency is the ability and privilege God gives us to choose and to act for ourselves.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note23\"><sup class=\"marker\">23<\/sup><\/a> Thus, agency is at the heart of the personal growth and experience that bless us as we follow the Savior.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note24\"><sup class=\"marker\">24<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147980002\" id=\"p19\">Agency was a principal issue in the premortal Council in Heaven and the conflict between those who chose to follow Christ and the followers of Satan.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note25\"><sup class=\"marker\">25<\/sup><\/a> Letting go of pride and control and choosing the Savior would allow us to have His light and His peace. But personal peace would be challenged when people exercised their agency in harmful and hurtful ways.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147980007\" id=\"p20\">I am confident that the peaceful assurance we felt in our hearts was strengthened by the knowledge we had of what the Savior of the world would accomplish in our behalf. This is beautifully set forth in <cite>Preach My Gospel<\/cite>: \u201cAs we rely on the Atonement of Jesus Christ, He can help us endure our trials, sicknesses, and pain. We can be filled with joy, <em>peace<\/em>, and consolation. All that is unfair about life can be made right through the Atonement of Jesus Christ.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note26\"><sup class=\"marker\">26<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"147980012\" id=\"title5\">Fourth: Build Zion in Our Hearts and Homes<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"147980017\" id=\"p21\">We are children of God and part of His family. We are also part of the family into which we are born. The institution of the family is the foundation for both happiness and peace. President RussellÂ M. Nelson has taught us\u2014and during this pandemic we have learned\u2014that the home-centered, Church-supported religious observance can \u201cunleash the power of families \u2026 to transform [our] home[s] into a sanctuary of faith.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note27\"><sup class=\"marker\">27<\/sup><\/a> If we have this religious observance in our homes, we will also have the Savior\u2019s peace.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note28\"><sup class=\"marker\">28<\/sup><\/a> We are aware that many of you do not have the blessings of righteous homes and contend regularly with those who choose unrighteousness.

Nelson. We will shortly have an opportunity to hear from him. He was prepared from the foundations of the world for this calling.

For many years he was a pioneer in open-heart surgery and was recognized worldwide. As remarkable as this preparation was to bless people all over the world with his medical skills, President Nelson\u2019s spiritual preparation was even more important.
