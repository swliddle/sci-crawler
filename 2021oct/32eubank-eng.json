It was made by the Kadado family who, for decades, owned three bakeries in Damascus, Syria. When war came, a blockade stopped food and supplies from reaching their part of the city. The Kadados began to starve. At the height of this desperate situation, Latter-day Saint Charities and some very courageous staff at Rahma Worldwide began serving a daily hot meal, along with milk for the little children. After a difficult time, the family began their life\u2014as well as their bakery\u2014once again in a new country. <\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147978841\" id=\"p31\">Recently, a box of cookies arrived at the Church offices with the following message: \u201cFor more than two months, we managed to get food from the Rahma\u2013Latter-day Saint [Charities] kitchen. Without it we would [have] starve[d] to death. Please accept this \u2026 sample from my shop as a small token of thanks.

I can report from my own experience how personally and devotedly the First Presidency takes that charge. As needs grow, the First Presidency has charged us to increase our humanitarian outreach in a significant way. They are interested in the largest trends and the smallest details. <\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147978928\" id=\"p33\">Recently, we brought to them one of the protective medical gowns that Beehive Clothing sewed for hospitals to use during the pandemic. As a medical doctor, President Russell M. Nelson was highly interested. He didn\u2019t want to just see it. He wanted to try it on\u2014check the cuffs and the length and the way it tied in the back. He told us later, with emotion in his voice, \u201cWhen you meet with people on your assignments, thank them for their fasting, their offerings, and their ministering in the name of the Lord.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"147978933\" id=\"title4\">Humanitarian Report<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"147978938\" id=\"p16\">At President Nelson\u2019s direction, I am reporting back to you about how The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is responding to hurricanes, earthquakes, refugee displacement\u2014and even a pandemic\u2014thanks to the kindness of the Latter-day Saints and many friends. While the more than 1,500 COVID-19 projects were certainly the largest focus of the Church\u2019s relief over the last 18 months, the Church also responded to 933 natural disasters and refugee crises in 108 countries. But statistics don\u2019t tell the whole story. Let me share four brief examples to illustrate the smallest taste of what is being done.<\/p>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h3 data-aid=\"147978943\" id=\"title5\">South African COVID Relief<\/h3>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"147978949\" id=\"p17\">Sixteen-year-old Dieke Mphuti of Welkom, South Africa, lost her parents years ago, leaving her to care for three younger siblings on her own. It was always daunting for her to find enough food, but COVID supply shortages and quarantines made it almost impossible. They were often hungry, scraping by only with the generosity of neighbors.<\/p>\n<img id=\"img1\" src=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/20/6c/206c5ca63dd69d8f66b1ff0c7488134a12341806/people_standing_outside.png\" data-img-id=\"5e6639b322f911ec9b75eeeeac1e708de9a7533d\" srcset=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/d8/f5/d8f5b03c643af80ade954910e71e55c322094d18/people_standing_outside.png 60w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/b9/c8/b9c840d1a52b54e97097485ee9d520998416beff/people_standing_outside.png 100w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/0d/8c/0d8cfb6c6c4f6d537342c3d975c331649f97f4fa/people_standing_outside.png 200w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/0d/01/0d0161671aa4097392b200c013b7a2c7fa5fc9f6/people_standing_outside.png 250w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/53/be/53be136fd23d38e7a1a0ca32c9afb7e936f830a3/people_standing_outside.png 320w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/20/6c/206c5ca63dd69d8f66b1ff0c7488134a12341806/people_standing_outside.png 500w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/8c/7d/8c7dd66aed5463e16d75bd7723b6eab314454837/people_standing_outside.png 640w\" data-assetId=\"5e6639b322f911ec9b75eeeeac1e708de9a7533d\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"323\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.5479876160990713\" alt=\"Dieke Mphuti\"/>\n<p data-aid=\"147978955\" id=\"p18\">On a sunny day in August 2020, Dieke was surprised by a knock at her door. She opened it to find two strangers\u2014one a Church representative from the area office in Johannesburg and the other an official from South Africa\u2019s Department of Social Development.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147978962\" id=\"p19\">The two organizations had teamed up to bring food to at-risk households. Relief washed over Dieke as she glimpsed the pile of cornmeal and other food staples, purchased with Church humanitarian funds. These would help her to sustain her family for several weeks until a government aid package could begin to take effect for her.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147978970\" id=\"p20\">Dieke\u2019s story is one of thousands of such experiences taking place across the world during the COVID pandemic thanks to your consecrated contributions.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h3 data-aid=\"147978978\" id=\"title6\">Afghan Relief at Ramstein<\/h3>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"147978979\" id=\"p21\">We have all seen recent images in the news: thousands of evacuees being flown from Afghanistan. Many arrived at air bases or other temporary locations in Qatar, the United States, Germany, and Spain before continuing to their final destinations. Their needs were immediate, and the Church responded with supplies and volunteers. At Ramstein Air Base in Germany, the Church provided large donations of diapers, baby formula, food, and shoes. <\/p>\n<img id=\"img2\" src=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/dd/50/dd50dacd3ad35a92dff8ee605ce006654762d29e/humanitarian_aid_afghan_refugees.png\" data-img-id=\"58a5244a22f911ec9f65eeeeac1ecd5af6ec0a2c\" srcset=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/1c/02/1c0257feebfad02132aaa5c82e5cde5edd63f046/humanitarian_aid_afghan_refugees.png 60w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/4e/e9/4ee91789bb5877c89f26eba36ef07e714f23e8eb/humanitarian_aid_afghan_refugees.png 100w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/e5/7e/e57e62ae3527c27be929a0ee6d56d40522b5c224/humanitarian_aid_afghan_refugees.png 200w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/16/7a/167ab6f0f2c3ab7d89a5b0aa8f13d665713f54dd/humanitarian_aid_afghan_refugees.png 250w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/e2/b4/e2b462c769c834ec1ebcf660573ca741cce04671/humanitarian_aid_afghan_refugees.png 320w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/dd/50/dd50dacd3ad35a92dff8ee605ce006654762d29e/humanitarian_aid_afghan_refugees.png 500w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/af/8c/af8c8b271eefbc8df26308009c92962a399d06ec/humanitarian_aid_afghan_refugees.png 640w\" data-assetId=\"58a5244a22f911ec9f65eeeeac1ecd5af6ec0a2c\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"323\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.5479876160990713\" alt=\"Humanitarian Aid for Afghan Refugees\"/>\n<img id=\"img3\" src=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/24/10/2410811690b2a2f42a103b5017d1bf00af99cf35/woman_sewing.png\" data-img-id=\"5c04ee8822f911ec9229eeeeac1e279666c68a9a\" srcset=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/f4/26/f42618bc8fb4afbdff12350d79b45afa3e069324/woman_sewing.png 60w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/5d/46/5d468b6ded31e8374a2d1a307b8f31f938d7e69c/woman_sewing.png 100w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/63/cd/63cd0f233672e627b7060e1b1c3056f0ac06632f/woman_sewing.png 200w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/ac/b9/acb9a938b05557b12d96f9b2e791827f4bb3551e/woman_sewing.png 250w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/3b/6c/3b6c939c29f1b6ff86ea1aeea56365db9c20b970/woman_sewing.png 320w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/24/10/2410811690b2a2f42a103b5017d1bf00af99cf35/woman_sewing.png 500w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/c0/d4/c0d435b6b5d6ab7ea5945f78f1f27cab3953b833/woman_sewing.png 640w\" data-assetId=\"5c04ee8822f911ec9229eeeeac1e279666c68a9a\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"323\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.5479876160990713\" alt=\"Sewing\"/>\n<p data-aid=\"147978985\" id=\"p34\">Some of the Relief Society sisters noticed that many Afghan women were using their husbands\u2019 shirts to cover their heads because their traditional head coverings had been ripped off in the frenzy at the Kabul airport. In an act of friendship that crossed any religious or cultural boundaries, the sisters of the Ramstein First Ward gathered to sew traditional Muslim clothing for Afghan women.

This humble man, a devout Catholic, whispered a prayer that God might send someone to help him. The very next morning, President Dan Hammon of the Germany Frankfurt Mission arrived on the street with a small band of missionaries wearing yellow Helping Hands vests. The water had reached up to 10 feet (3 m) on the shopkeeper\u2019s walls, leaving behind a deep layer of mud. The volunteers shoveled out the mud, removed the carpet and drywall, and piled everything in the street for removal. The overjoyed shopkeeper worked alongside them for hours, amazed that the Lord had sent a group of His servants to answer his prayer\u2014and within 24 hours!<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\">6<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<\/section>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"147979025\" id=\"title9\">\u201cWell, I Pray That He\u2019ll Use Us\u201d<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"147979028\" id=\"p24\">Speaking of the Church\u2019s humanitarian efforts, Elder Jeffrey R.
