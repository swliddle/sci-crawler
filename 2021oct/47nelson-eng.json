This complex project includes major reinforcement of its original foundation, which has served well for more than a century. But this temple must stand much longer. In late May, I inspected the progress on this massive project. I thought you would appreciate seeing what my wife Wendy and I saw. I think you\u2019ll see why the hymn \u201cHow Firm a Foundation\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\">1<\/sup><\/a> has come to have new meaning for us.<\/p>\n<video controls=\"controls\" poster=\"https://mediasrv.churchofjesuschrist.org/media-services/GA/videoStill/6275396779001\" thumbnail=\"https://mediasrv.churchofjesuschrist.org/media-services/GA/thumbnail/6275396779001\" data-video-title=\"President Nelson - Temple Foundation\" data-video-description=\"Short Description: A video presented during President Nelson's talk during the Sunday morning session of October 2021 general Conference.\" data-video-id=\"6275396779001\" data-ip=\"Download &amp; Streaming\" data-duration=\"123000\" data-assetId=\"4D31BD36564457BED2A43D12EEA66C5E452B3CA7\" data-ref-id=\"4D31BD36564457BED2A43D12EEA66C5E452B3CA7\" id=\"video3\"><source src=\"https://mediasrv.churchofjesuschrist.org/media-services/GA/type/6275396779001/hls.m3u8\" type=\"application/vnd.apple.mpegurl\"/><source src=\"https://mediasrv.churchofjesuschrist.org/media-services/GA/size/6275396779001/640/360/980000\" type=\"video/mp4\" data-width=\"640\" data-height=\"360\" data-file-size=\"15247303\"/><source src=\"https://mediasrv.churchofjesuschrist.org/media-services/GA/size/6275396779001/1280/720/2113000\" type=\"video/mp4\" data-width=\"1280\" data-height=\"720\" data-file-size=\"32795202\"/><source src=\"https://media2.ldscdn.org/assets/social-media/october-2021-gc-pad-and-social-clips/2021-10-0060-president-nelson-temple-foundation-1080p-eng.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\" data-width=\"1920\" data-height=\"1080\" data-file-size=\"95115354\"/><\/video>\n<p data-aid=\"147978472\" id=\"p4\"><strong>Video from the site of the Salt Lake Temple renovation:<\/strong> \u201cWe are looking at the original foundation of the Salt Lake Temple. I am standing in an area beneath what was the Garden Room. As I examine the craftsmanship of this entire building, I marvel at what the pioneers accomplished. I am totally in awe when I consider that they built this magnificent temple with only tools and techniques available to them more than a century ago.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147978474\" id=\"p5\">\u201cThese many decades later, however, if we examine the foundation closely, we can see the effects of erosion, gaps in the original stonework, and varying stages of stability in the masonry.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147978475\" id=\"p6\">\u201cNow as I witness what modern engineers, architects, and construction experts can do to reinforce that original foundation, I am absolutely amazed. Their work is astonishing!<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147978477\" id=\"p7\">\u201cThe foundation of any building, particularly one as large as this one, must be strong and resilient enough to withstand earthquakes, corrosion, high winds, and the inevitable settling that affects all buildings. The complex task of strengthening now underway will reinforce this sacred temple with the foundation that can and will stand the test of time.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147978479\" id=\"p9\">We are sparing no effort to give this venerable temple, which had become increasingly <em>vulnerable<\/em>, a foundation that will withstand the forces of nature into the Millennium. In like manner, it is now time that we each implement extraordinary measures\u2014perhaps measures we have never taken before\u2014to strengthen our <em>personal spiritual<\/em> foundations. Unprecedented times call for unprecedented measures.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147978481\" id=\"p10\">My dear brothers and sisters, these <em>are<\/em> the latter days. If you and I are to withstand the forthcoming perils and pressures, it is imperative that we each have a <em>firm<\/em> spiritual foundation built upon the rock of our Redeemer, Jesus Christ.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\">2<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147978483\" id=\"p11\">So I ask each of you, how firm is <em>your<\/em> foundation? And what reinforcements to your testimony and understanding of the gospel are needed?<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147978485\" id=\"p12\">The temple lies at the center of strengthening our faith and spiritual fortitude because the Savior and His doctrine are the very heart of the temple. Everything taught in the temple, through instruction and through the Spirit, increases our understanding of Jesus Christ. His essential ordinances bind us to Him through sacred priesthood covenants. Then, as we keep our covenants, He endows us with <em>His<\/em> healing, strengthening power.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\">3<\/sup><\/a> And oh, how we will need His power in the days ahead.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147978487\" id=\"p13\">We have been promised that \u201cif [we] are prepared [we] shall not fear.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\">4<\/sup><\/a> This assurance has profound implications today. The Lord has declared that despite today\u2019s unprecedented challenges, those who build their foundations upon Jesus Christ, and have learned how to draw upon His power, need not succumb to the unique anxieties of this era.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147978488\" id=\"p14\">Temple ordinances and covenants are ancient. The Lord instructed Adam and Eve to pray, make covenants, and offer sacrifices.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\">5<\/sup><\/a> Indeed, \u201cwhenever the Lord has had a people on the earth who will obey His word, they have been commanded to build temples.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\">6<\/sup><\/a> The standard works are replete with references to temple teachings, clothing, language, and more.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\">7<\/sup><\/a> <em>Everything<\/em> we believe and <em>every<\/em> promise God has made to His covenant people come together in the temple. In <em>every<\/em> age, the temple has underscored the precious truth that those who make covenants with God and keep them are children of the covenant.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147978491\" id=\"p15\">Thus, in the house of the Lord, we can make the same covenants with God that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob made. And we can receive the same blessings!<\/p>\n<img id=\"img1\" src=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/f6/12/f6125ab11e3690abd8d91d009cf942a4d6f53b68/kirtland_nauvoo_temple_composite.png\" data-img-id=\"5dec75dc22f911ec8410eeeeac1e04a283c608bc\" srcset=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/87/96/8796c31cc83694919daeb40bfef7be00b78354a4/kirtland_nauvoo_temple_composite.png 60w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/a7/6f/a76f9700c3385f51c4d98a5900333dbf043d32ce/kirtland_nauvoo_temple_composite.png 100w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/05/bb/05bbd248376a713ea7665e1414a2394bdc561ca1/kirtland_nauvoo_temple_composite.png 200w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/2d/49/2d494bdc8a432f3c86b291098be70665ae7021fb/kirtland_nauvoo_temple_composite.png 250w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/ee/6a/ee6a702270af226b8096e3b44b4cdc09533482ea/kirtland_nauvoo_temple_composite.png 320w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/f6/12/f6125ab11e3690abd8d91d009cf942a4d6f53b68/kirtland_nauvoo_temple_composite.png 500w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/fa/6f/fa6f1009c5875a1aa1ff65fca7fcd9765414e688/kirtland_nauvoo_temple_composite.png 640w\" data-assetId=\"5dec75dc22f911ec8410eeeeac1e04a283c608bc\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"323\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.5479876160990713\" alt=\"Kirtland and Nauvoo Temples\"/>\n<p data-aid=\"147978492\" id=\"p16\">Temples have been part of <em>this<\/em> dispensation from its earliest days.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\">8<\/sup><\/a> Elijah committed the keys of sealing authority to Joseph Smith in the Kirtland Temple.

After administering the endowment to Brigham Young in May 1842, Joseph told Brigham, \u201cThis is not arranged right, but we have done the best we could under the circumstances in which we are placed, and I wish you to take this matter in hand and organize and systematize all these ceremonies.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\">11<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147978496\" id=\"p18\">Following the Prophet\u2019s death, President Young oversaw the completion of the Nauvoo Temple<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\">12<\/sup><\/a> and later built temples in the Utah Territory. At the dedication of the lower stories of the St. George Temple, Brigham Young vigorously declared the urgency of vicarious temple work when he said, \u201cWhen I think upon this subject, I want the tongues of seven thunders to wake up the people.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\">13<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147978498\" id=\"p19\">From that time forward, temple ordinances were gradually refined. President Harold B. Lee explained why procedures, policies, and even the administration of temple ordinances continue to change within the Savior\u2019s restored Church. President Lee said: \u201cThe principles of the gospel of Jesus Christ are divine. Nobody changes the principles and [doctrine] of the Church except the Lord by revelation. But methods change as the inspired direction comes to those who preside at a given time.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note14\"><sup class=\"marker\">14<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147978500\" id=\"p20\">Consider how administering the sacrament has changed over the years. In earlier days, the water of the sacrament was offered to the congregation in one large vessel. Everyone drank from it. Now we use individual disposable cups. The procedure changed, but the covenants remain the same.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147978502\" id=\"p21\">Ponder these three truths:<\/p>\n<ol class=\"decimal\" start=\"1\">\n<li data-marker=\"1.\">\n<p data-aid=\"147978504\" id=\"p22\">The Restoration is a process, not an event, and will continue until the Lord comes again.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"2.\">\n<p data-aid=\"147978507\" id=\"p23\">The ultimate objective of the gathering of Israel<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note15\"><sup class=\"marker\">15<\/sup><\/a> is to bring the blessings of the temple to God\u2019s faithful children.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"3.\">\n<p data-aid=\"147978509\" id=\"p24\">As we seek how to accomplish <em>that<\/em> objective more effectively, the Lord reveals more insights. The ongoing Restoration needs ongoing revelation.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p data-aid=\"147978511\" id=\"p25\">The First Presidency and Quorum of the Twelve Apostles have often asked the Lord if there are better ways to take the blessings of the temple to His faithful children. We seek guidance regularly on how to ensure worldwide accuracy and consistency of temple instruction, covenants, and ordinances despite differences in language and culture.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147978513\" id=\"p26\">Under the Lord\u2019s direction and in answer to our prayers, recent procedural adjustments have been made. <em>He<\/em> is the One who wants you to understand with great clarity exactly what you are making covenants to do. <em>He<\/em> is the One who wants you to experience fully <em>His<\/em> sacred ordinances. <em>He<\/em> wants you to comprehend your privileges, promises, and responsibilities. <em>He<\/em> wants you to have spiritual insights and awakenings you\u2019ve never had before. This He desires for <em>all<\/em> temple patrons, no matter where they live.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147978515\" id=\"p27\">Current adjustments in temple procedures, and others that will follow, are continuing evidence that the Lord is actively directing His Church. He is providing opportunities for each of us to bolster our spiritual foundations more effectively by centering our lives on Him and on the ordinances and covenants of His temple. When you bring your temple recommend, a contrite heart, and a seeking mind to the Lord\u2019s house of learning, <em>He<\/em> will teach you.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147978517\" id=\"p28\">Should distance, health challenges, or other constraints prohibit your temple attendance for a season, I invite you to set a regular time to rehearse in your mind the covenants you have made.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147978518\" id=\"p29\">If you don\u2019t yet love to attend the temple, go more often\u2014not less. Let the Lord, through His Spirit, teach and inspire you there. I promise you that over time, the temple will become a place of safety, solace, and revelation.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147978519\" id=\"p30\">If it were possible for me to speak one-on-one with every young adult, I would plead with you to seek a companion with whom you can be sealed in the temple. You may wonder what difference this will make in your life. I promise it will make <em>all<\/em> the difference! As you marry in the temple and return repeatedly, you will be strengthened and guided in your decisions.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147978520\" id=\"p31\">If I could speak with each husband and wife who have <em>still<\/em> not been sealed in the temple, I would plead with you to take the necessary steps to receive that crowning, life-changing ordinance.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note16\"><sup class=\"marker\">16<\/sup><\/a> Will it make a difference? Only if you want to progress forever and be together forever. <em>Wishing<\/em> to be together forever will not make it so. No other ceremony or contract will make it so.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note17\"><sup class=\"marker\">17<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147978521\" id=\"p32\">If I could speak to each man or woman who longs for marriage but has not yet found his or her eternal companion, I would urge you not to wait until marriage to be endowed in the house of the Lord. Begin now to learn and experience what it means to be armed with priesthood power.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147978522\" id=\"p33\">And to each of you who has made temple covenants, I plead with you to seek\u2014prayerfully and consistently\u2014to understand temple covenants and ordinances.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note18\"><sup class=\"marker\">18<\/sup><\/a> Spiritual doors will open. You will learn how to part the veil between heaven and earth, how to ask for God\u2019s angels to attend you, and how better to receive direction from heaven. Your diligent efforts to do so will reinforce and strengthen your spiritual foundation.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147978523\" id=\"p34\">My dear brothers and sisters, when renovations on the Salt Lake Temple are completed, there will be <em>no safer<\/em> place during an earthquake in the Salt Lake Valley than inside that temple.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147978524\" id=\"p35\">Likewise, whenever any kind of upheaval occurs in your life, the safest place to be <em>spiritually<\/em> is living <em>inside<\/em> your temple covenants!<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147978525\" id=\"p36\">Please believe me when I say that when your spiritual foundation is built solidly upon Jesus Christ, you have <em>no need to fear<\/em>. As you are true to your covenants made in the temple, you will be strengthened by His power. Then, when spiritual earthquakes occur, you will be able to stand <em>strong<\/em> because your spiritual foundation is solid and immovable.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147978526\" id=\"p37\">I love you, dear brothers and sisters. These truths I know: God, our Heavenly Father, wants <em>you<\/em> to choose to come home to Him. His plan of eternal progression is not complicated, and it honors your agency. You are free to choose who you will be\u2014and with whom you will be\u2014in the world to come!<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147978527\" id=\"p38\">God lives! Jesus is the Christ! This is His Church, restored to help you fulfill your divine destiny.
