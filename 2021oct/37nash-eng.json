Be you and hold up the light.<\/p>\n<\/header>\n<div class=\"body-block\">\n<p data-aid=\"147979759\" id=\"p1\">While on a flight to Peru a few years ago, I was seated next to a self-proclaimed atheist. He asked me why I believe in God. In the delightful conversation that ensued, I told him that I believed in God because Joseph Smith saw Him\u2014and then I added that my knowledge of God also came from personal, real spiritual experience. I shared my belief that \u201call things denote there is a God\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\">1<\/sup><\/a> and asked him how he believed the earth\u2014this oasis of life in the vacuum of space\u2014came into existence. He replied that, in his words, \u201cthe accident\u201d could have happened over eons of time. When I explained how highly improbable it would be for an \u201caccident\u201d to produce such beauty and order, he was quiet for a time and then good-naturedly said, \u201cYou got me.\u201d I asked if he would read the Book of Mormon. He said he would, so I sent him a copy.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979762\" id=\"p2\">Years later I made a new friend while in an airport in Lagos, Nigeria. We became acquainted as he checked my passport. I asked him about his religious beliefs, and he expressed strong faith in God. I shared the joy and vibrancy of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ and asked if he would like to learn more from the missionaries. He said yes, was taught, and was baptized. A year or two later, as I walked through the airport in Liberia, I heard a voice call out my name. I turned, and that same young man approached with a big smile. We joyfully embraced, and he let me know that he was active in the Church and working with the missionaries to teach his girlfriend.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979767\" id=\"p3\">Now, I do not know whether my atheist friend ever read the Book of Mormon or joined the Church. My second friend did. For both of them, my responsibility<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\">2<\/sup><\/a>\u2014my opportunity\u2014was the same: hold up the gospel light\u2014to love, share, and invite each of them in a normal, natural way.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\">3<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979769\" id=\"p4\">Brothers and sisters, I have experienced the blessings of sharing the gospel, and they are remarkable. Here are a few of them:<\/p>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"147979773\" id=\"title2\">Sharing the Gospel Brings Joy and Hope<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"147979775\" id=\"p5\">You see, you and I know that we lived as children of our Heavenly Father before coming to this earth<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\">4<\/sup><\/a> and that the earth was created for the purpose of giving each person the opportunity to obtain a body, gain experience, learn, and grow in order to receive eternal life\u2014which is God\u2019s life.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\">5<\/sup><\/a> Heavenly Father knew we would suffer and sin on earth, so He sent His Son, whose \u201cmatchless life\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\">6<\/sup><\/a> and infinite atoning sacrifice<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\">7<\/sup><\/a> make it possible for us to be forgiven, healed, and made whole.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\">8<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979778\" id=\"p6\">To know these truths is life changing! When a person learns the glorious purpose of life, comes to understand that Christ forgives and succors those who follow Him, and then chooses to follow Christ into the waters of baptism, life changes for the better\u2014even when the external circumstances of life do not.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979781\" id=\"p20\">A radiantly happy sister I met in Onitsha, Nigeria, told me that from the time she learned the gospel and was baptized (and now I use her words), \u201ceverything is good for me. I am happy. I am in heaven.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\">9<\/sup><\/a> Sharing the gospel kindles joy and hope in the souls of both giver and receiver. Truly, \u201chow great shall be your joy\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note10\"><sup class=\"marker\">10<\/sup><\/a> as you share the gospel! Sharing the gospel is joy upon joy, hope upon hope.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note11\"><sup class=\"marker\">11<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"147979783\" id=\"title3\">Sharing the Gospel Brings God\u2019s Power into Our Lives<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"147979787\" id=\"p7\">When we were baptized, each of us entered into a perpetual<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note12\"><sup class=\"marker\">12<\/sup><\/a> covenant with God to \u201cserve him and keep his commandments,\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note13\"><sup class=\"marker\">13<\/sup><\/a> which includes \u201cto stand as witnesses of [Him] at all times and in all things, and in all places.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note14\"><sup class=\"marker\">14<\/sup><\/a> As we \u201cabide in\u201d Him by keeping this covenant, the enlivening, sustaining, sanctifying power of godliness flows into our lives from Christ, just as a branch receives nourishment from the vine.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note15\"><sup class=\"marker\">15<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"147979790\" id=\"title4\">Sharing the Gospel Protects Us from Temptation<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"147979792\" id=\"p8\">The Lord commands:<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979795\" id=\"p9\">\u201cHold up your light that it may shine unto the world. Behold I am the light which ye shall hold up\u2014that which ye have seen me do. \u2026<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979798\" id=\"p10\">\u201c\u2026 I have commanded that \u2026 ye should come unto me, that ye might feel and see; even so shall ye do unto the world; and whosoever breaketh this commandment suffereth himself to be led into temptation.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note16\"><sup class=\"marker\">16<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979799\" id=\"p11\">Choosing to not hold up the gospel light moves us to the shadows, where we are susceptible to temptation. Importantly, the converse is true: choosing to hold up the gospel light brings us more fully into that light and the protection it provides against temptation. What a tremendous blessing in today\u2019s world!<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"147979801\" id=\"title5\">Sharing the Gospel Brings Healing<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"147979802\" id=\"p12\">Sister Tiffany Myloan accepted the invitation to support the missionaries despite very heavy personal struggles, including questions about her faith. She recently told me that supporting the missionaries has renewed her faith and sense of well-being. In her words, \u201cMissionary work is so healing.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note17\"><sup class=\"marker\">17<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979806\" id=\"p13\">Joy. Hope.

And the truth has never been more accessible.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979815\" id=\"p21\">Jimmy Ton, who grew up Buddhist, was impressed by a family who shared their life on YouTube. When he learned that they were members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, he studied the gospel online by himself, read the Book of Mormon using the app, and was baptized after meeting with the missionaries in college.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note20\"><sup class=\"marker\">20<\/sup><\/a> Elder Ton is now a full-time missionary himself.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979818\" id=\"p15\">He and his fellow missionaries around the world are the Lord\u2019s battalion\u2014to quote our prophet.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note21\"><sup class=\"marker\">21<\/sup><\/a> These missionaries buck the trend of the world: while surveys report that Gen Z is turning <em>away<\/em> from God,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note22\"><sup class=\"marker\">22<\/sup><\/a> our stripling warrior<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note23\"><sup class=\"marker\">23<\/sup><\/a> elders and sisters are turning people <em>to<\/em> God. And increasing numbers of members of the Church are uniting with the missionaries in sharing the gospel, helping more and more friends to come unto Christ and His Church.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979821\" id=\"p16\">Our Latter-day Saints in Liberia helped 507 friends enter the waters of baptism during the 10 months there were no full-time missionaries serving in their country.
