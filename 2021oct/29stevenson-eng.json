The first element of the restored gospel\u2014God\u2019s work of salvation and exaltation\u2014focuses on divinely appointed responsibilities. The second element reminds us that the gospel is plain, precious, and simple.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"147978838\" id=\"title3\">Divinely Appointed Responsibilities<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"147978845\" id=\"p3\">To receive eternal life, we must \u201ccome unto Christ, and be perfected in him.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note1\"><sup class=\"marker\">1<\/sup><\/a> As we come unto Christ and help others do the same, we participate in God\u2019s work of salvation and exaltation, which focuses on divinely appointed responsibilities.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note2\"><sup class=\"marker\">2<\/sup><\/a> These divine responsibilities align themselves with priesthood keys restored by Moses, Elias, and Elijah, as recorded in the 110th section of the Doctrine and Covenants,<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note3\"><sup class=\"marker\">3<\/sup><\/a> and the second great commandment given to us by Jesus Christ to love our neighbor as ourselves.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\">4<\/sup><\/a> They are found on the first two pages of the updated <cite>General Handbook<\/cite>, available to all members.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147978852\" id=\"p34\">If hearing the words \u201cGeneral Handbook\u201d or \u201cdivinely appointed responsibilities\u201d causes you to shudder in fear of complexity, please don\u2019t. These responsibilities are simple, inspirational, motivating, and doable.

Oaks observed: \u201cWe are taught many small and simple things in the gospel of Jesus Christ. We need to be reminded that in total and over a significant period of time, those seemingly small things bring to pass great things.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note6\"><sup class=\"marker\">6<\/sup><\/a> Jesus Christ Himself describes that His yoke is easy and His burden is light.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\">7<\/sup><\/a> We should all strive to keep the gospel simple\u2014in our lives, in our families, in our classes and quorums, and in our wards and stakes.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147978904\" id=\"p10\">As you listen to the following stories I will share with you, recognize that they have been carefully chosen to inspire on the one hand and to inform on the other.

Then I sensed a movement to one side. I put my arm in the water, got hold of a T-shirt, and pulled the little boy up. He started gasping, coughing, and crying.

One day a stake president in the CÃºcuta stake in Colombia accompanied the stake Young Women president to visit two young women\u2014and their older teenage brother\u2014who were going through some terrible struggles. Recently their father had passed away, and their mother had passed away a year before. The three siblings were now left all alone in their small, humble shelter. The walls were made of crude wood lined with plastic bags, and the corrugated tin roof covered only the area where they slept.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147978973\" id=\"p20\">Following their visit, these leaders knew they needed to help. Through the ward council, a plan to help them began to emerge. Ward and stake leaders\u2014Relief Society, elders quorum, Young Men, Young Women\u2014and many families all set themselves to the task of blessing this family.<\/p>\n<img id=\"img7\" src=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/99/93/9993860e67cdcf4f459d4f4bb2037ab42fa4078a/home_construction.png\" data-img-id=\"5bfba27c22f911ecb34aeeeeac1e8d8a13adabaf\" srcset=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/a4/66/a466e55e385d6a6db496e0b07ce9677c6cd6653f/home_construction.png 60w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/0e/bb/0ebb2ad54967410f73151ebfffb6ad6568127e1f/home_construction.png 100w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/f3/bd/f3bd0bec2b81aa9588c8d17d4d33436edad4e18a/home_construction.png 200w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/bb/fb/bbfb3bc5913765fb972a0c0f137cb2433465a161/home_construction.png 250w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/da/e3/dae39b7c8a84e2114eabcbafb36f11f568bd1878/home_construction.png 320w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/99/93/9993860e67cdcf4f459d4f4bb2037ab42fa4078a/home_construction.png 500w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/9f/92/9f92a5fdac18328a8463bb6397582d60a87685da/home_construction.png 640w\" data-assetId=\"5bfba27c22f911ecb34aeeeeac1e8d8a13adabaf\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"323\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.5479876160990713\" alt=\"Home Construction\"/>\n<img id=\"img8\" src=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/68/9f/689f3eca393bca062389b39d0a521c3255ddd2fe/home_construction.png\" data-img-id=\"57eb714e22f911ecbc5aeeeeac1e477b69e76f63\" srcset=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/5a/20/5a20c1725d907d7a5ebefaf000aa7c42e3ecf27b/home_construction.png 60w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/38/db/38db8035649b8b6244877b730c3b9cbae55af039/home_construction.png 100w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/64/99/6499ec362a1935a8ef110d9d0ed846e6a23da597/home_construction.png 200w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/9b/4c/9b4cc103af7470d400df01c5facc4e9c3b353178/home_construction.png 250w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/ea/ec/eaec07ae3befa7df9e9aa75d89a7c215a08d9507/home_construction.png 320w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/68/9f/689f3eca393bca062389b39d0a521c3255ddd2fe/home_construction.png 500w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/9d/a1/9da1cf8f31a8dc790f9ec9c78cd181787b06ff5b/home_construction.png 640w\" data-assetId=\"57eb714e22f911ecbc5aeeeeac1e477b69e76f63\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"323\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.5479876160990713\" alt=\"Home Construction\"/>\n<p data-aid=\"147978981\" id=\"p21\">The ward organizations contacted several ward members who work in construction.

Seventeen-year-old Cleiton of Cape Verde had no idea what would happen as a result of walking into his ward\u2019s seminary class one day. But his life and the lives of others would be forever changed because he did.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979008\" id=\"p24\">Cleiton, along with his mother and older brother, had been baptized into the Church some time earlier, and yet the family stopped attending. His single act of attending seminary would prove to be a hinge point for the family.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979009\" id=\"p25\">The other youth in the seminary class were warm and welcoming. They made Cleiton feel at home and encouraged him to attend another activity. He did so and soon began attending his other Church meetings. A wise bishop saw spiritual potential in Cleiton and invited him to be his assistant. \u201cFrom that moment on,\u201d says Bishop Cruz, \u201cCleiton became an example and an influence to other young people.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979014\" id=\"p26\">The first person Cleiton invited back to church was his mother, then his older brother. He then widened his circle to friends. One of those friends was a young man his own age, Wilson. Upon his very first meeting with the missionaries, Wilson expressed his desire to be baptized. The missionaries were impressed and amazed at how much Cleiton had already shared with Wilson.<\/p>\n<img id=\"img10\" src=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/ab/91/ab91dc2e5036ce3d67e2291e7ef818553ba1fc9a/youth_young_men.png\" data-img-id=\"5549010b22f911ecbc5aeeeeac1e477bb5f4b420\" srcset=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/cc/5a/cc5a70389a8cc8acc2e5661d216fdabc85f7329d/youth_young_men.png 60w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/73/a6/73a6bebf7445564af4b3263838e4bf2c228df9ef/youth_young_men.png 100w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/5e/52/5e5233d5201af54a917e46095de33b79a004a96b/youth_young_men.png 200w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/50/f2/50f26206ef89bce87ea1354ecfaa594c41b28370/youth_young_men.png 250w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/c6/11/c61152ee21631c8530b3a544f09062ec74cd11d1/youth_young_men.png 320w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/ab/91/ab91dc2e5036ce3d67e2291e7ef818553ba1fc9a/youth_young_men.png 500w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/d3/bf/d3bf2f22034c5cc156c0774e1b7ec1c7f98dc23a/youth_young_men.png 640w\" data-assetId=\"5549010b22f911ecbc5aeeeeac1e477bb5f4b420\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"323\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.5479876160990713\" alt=\"Leon Cruz, Cleiton Moreira, and Wilson Barros\"/>\n<img id=\"img11\" src=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/f7/bf/f7bf3358f7d57fff192a87f706ef1313ca7e8a59/church_members_cape_verde.png\" data-img-id=\"56e747a922f911ec9f65eeeeac1ecd5ad7d305dc\" srcset=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/e7/32/e7322d3cec403f8eed4e02a085e2b7cbf2b5ad18/church_members_cape_verde.png 60w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/df/e9/dfe9799c9f575efd2f7126b010054f973dbe362e/church_members_cape_verde.png 100w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/29/88/2988a45a00dedc5a9b0c4959e8f91933c2dda30e/church_members_cape_verde.png 200w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/54/48/54485fb34537f93ecd58e7b39b08bbe3f09872e8/church_members_cape_verde.png 250w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/8e/2d/8e2df536ddcd7538de8325da82525bb442de30eb/church_members_cape_verde.png 320w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/f7/bf/f7bf3358f7d57fff192a87f706ef1313ca7e8a59/church_members_cape_verde.png 500w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/f7/57/f75731a17e8fbb460d8c5a877bc08d72ba26450d/church_members_cape_verde.png 640w\" data-assetId=\"56e747a922f911ec9f65eeeeac1ecd5ad7d305dc\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"323\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.5479876160990713\" alt=\"Church Members\"/>\n<img id=\"img12\" src=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/53/9a/539a7ebf9249dfea7f0770d82ff90f2cdb6d7b6d/church_members.png\" data-img-id=\"5671c99d22f911ecbc5aeeeeac1e477bc58dfdc0\" srcset=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/c6/38/c638ec3df63cad145d2758bc82ac0727cf85be8c/church_members.png 60w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/9a/ea/9aeab733e134ffe45dfbce337f20e0bfaa22ccb3/church_members.png 100w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/c0/67/c067f25aee1de03c2c11667f6b74d934659e6aa5/church_members.png 200w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/22/e4/22e4cff94e8871666e2a79fd701a771ed5095fa1/church_members.png 250w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/01/bd/01bd5560021455b59f9e2b3b3a94e95242389091/church_members.png 320w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/53/9a/539a7ebf9249dfea7f0770d82ff90f2cdb6d7b6d/church_members.png 500w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/a5/c1/a5c11022fe88487f8e8d28f3841b47e3dec561b5/church_members.png 640w\" data-assetId=\"5671c99d22f911ecbc5aeeeeac1e477bc58dfdc0\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"323\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.5479876160990713\" alt=\"Church Members\"/>\n<p data-aid=\"147979017\" id=\"p27\">Cleiton\u2019s efforts didn\u2019t stop there. He helped other less-active members return, in addition to sharing the gospel with friends of other faiths. Today the ward has 35 active youth, with a thriving seminary program, thanks in large part to Cleiton\u2019s efforts to love, share, and invite. Cleiton and his older brother, ClÃ©ber, are both preparing to serve full-time missions.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"147979022\" id=\"title8\">Uniting Families for Eternity<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"147979027\" id=\"p28\">Finally, let me share a beautiful example of uniting families for eternity. Lydia from Kharkiv, Ukraine, first learned about the temple from the missionaries. Immediately, Lydia felt a fervent desire to attend the temple, and after her baptism, she began preparation to receive a temple recommend.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979030\" id=\"p29\">Lydia attended the Freiberg Germany Temple to receive her endowment and then spent several days doing proxy work there. Following the dedication of the Kyiv Ukraine Temple, Lydia attended the temple more frequently. She and her husband, Anatoly, were eternally sealed there and later called to serve as temple missionaries. Together they have found more than 15,000 names of ancestors and have worked to provide temple ordinances for them.<\/p>\n<img id=\"img13\" src=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/b8/58/b85850bd247a2c1798b2e04393794908c8f3464c/lidiya_dudiki.png\" data-img-id=\"5d0411af22f911ec9645eeeeac1eed486fdf6b7b\" srcset=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/ec/17/ec17baccf1146f4aecfa4dd932c3b409cfc40278/lidiya_dudiki.png 60w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/63/f0/63f080d9fa3f797167c225615297766d0e75879c/lidiya_dudiki.png 100w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/e3/36/e336f022c36dd0b23d405ed930372aa1e078c34f/lidiya_dudiki.png 200w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/4f/a4/4fa440c62f1e320e4265dc97e05b91e0f5b717c6/lidiya_dudiki.png 250w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/ad/e1/ade19e34cf70c6fdec1f34de267ed80da04c6f70/lidiya_dudiki.png 320w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/b8/58/b85850bd247a2c1798b2e04393794908c8f3464c/lidiya_dudiki.png 500w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/b3/33/b3337a70b1078291f192e42834c170f55864e764/lidiya_dudiki.png 640w\" data-assetId=\"5d0411af22f911ec9645eeeeac1eed486fdf6b7b\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"281\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.7793594306049823\" alt=\"Lidiya Dudiki\"/>\n<p data-aid=\"147979033\" id=\"p30\">When asked about her feelings regarding temple work, Lydia says, \u201cWhat did I receive in the temple? I have made new covenants with God. My testimony has been strengthened. I have learned to receive personal revelation. I am able to perform saving ordinances for my deceased ancestors. And I can love and serve other people.\u201d She concluded with this very true statement: \u201cThe Lord wants to see us in the temple often.\u201d<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"147979035\" id=\"title9\">Conclusion<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"147979038\" id=\"p31\">I am inspired by the goodness of these Latter-day Saints, each with diverse and varied backgrounds, centered in these four stories. Much can be learned from miraculous outcomes brought through the simple application of simple gospel principles. All they did is within our grasp as well.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979042\" id=\"p32\">May we keep the gospel simple as we take upon us our divinely appointed responsibilities: To <em>live the gospel of Jesus Christ<\/em> so as to be sensitive to promptings, as did Jens in Denmark. To <em>care for those in need<\/em>, as demonstrated by the members of the CÃºcuta stake in Colombia in providing shelter to orphaned ward members. To <em>invite all to receive the gospel<\/em>, in the way that Cleiton from the African island country of Cape Verde did with his friends and family. Finally, to <em>unite families for eternity<\/em>, as exemplified by Sister Lydia from Ukraine through her own temple ordinances, family history efforts, and service in the temple.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979045\" id=\"p36\">Doing so will surely bring joy and peace. Of this I promise and testify\u2014and of Jesus Christ as our Savior and our Redeemer\u2014in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<\/div>\n<footer class=\"notes\">\n<p class=\"title\" data-aid=\"147979049\" id=\"note_title1\">Notes<\/p>\n<ol class=\"decimal\" data-type=\"marker\" start=\"1\">\n<li data-marker=\"1.\" id=\"note1\" data-full-marker=\"1.\">\n<p data-aid=\"147979052\" id=\"note1_p1\"><a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/bofm/moro/10.32?lang=eng#p32\">Moroni 10:32<\/a>.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"2.\" id=\"note2\" data-full-marker=\"2.\">\n<p data-aid=\"147979053\" id=\"note2_p1\">See <cite>General Handbook: Serving in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints<\/cite>, <a class=\"cross-ref\" href=\"/study/manual/general-handbook/1-work-of-salvation-and-exaltation?lang=eng&amp;para=title_number3#title_number3\">1.2<\/a>, ChurchofJesusChrist.org.<\/p>\n<\/li>\n<li data-marker=\"3.\" id=\"note3\" data-full-marker=\"3.\">\n<p data-aid=\"147979057\" id=\"note3_p1\">See <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/110.11-16?lang=eng#p11\">Doctrine and Covenants 110:11\u201316<\/a>.
