Not long ago, scientists at the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics tested that theory. They took participants to a thick forest and gave them simple instructions: \u201cWalk in a straight line.\u201d There were no visible landmarks. The test subjects had to rely solely on their sense of direction.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979113\" id=\"p6\">How do you think they did?<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979114\" id=\"p7\">The scientists concluded, \u201cPeople really [do] walk in circles when they do not have reliable cues to their walking direction.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note4\"><sup class=\"marker\">4<\/sup><\/a> When questioned afterwards, some participants self-confidently claimed that they had not deviated in the slightest. Despite their high confidence, GPS data showed that they walked in loops as tight as 20 meters in diameter.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979115\" id=\"p8\">Why do we do have such a hard time walking in a straight line? Some researchers hypothesize that small, seemingly insignificant deviations in terrain make the difference. Others have pointed to the fact that we all have one leg that is slightly stronger than the other. \u201cMore likely,\u201d however, we struggle to walk straight ahead \u201c[because] of increasing uncertainty about where straight ahead is.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note5\"><sup class=\"marker\">5<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979116\" id=\"p9\">Whatever the cause, it is human nature: without reliable landmarks, we drift off course.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"147979117\" id=\"title3\">Straying from the Path<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"147979119\" id=\"p10\">Isn\u2019t it interesting how small, seemingly insignificant factors can make a major difference in our lives?<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979121\" id=\"p11\">I know this from personal experience as a pilot. Every time I started the approach to an airport, I knew that much of my remaining work would consist of making constant minor course corrections to safely direct the aircraft to our desired landing runway.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979123\" id=\"p12\">You might have a similar experience when driving a vehicle. Wind, road irregularities, imperfect wheel alignment, inattentiveness\u2014not to mention the actions of other drivers\u2014all can push you off your intended path.

Like the participants in the Max Planck study, we may not realize when we veer off course. We may even have high confidence that we are walking a straight line. But the fact is that without the help of landmarks to guide us, we inevitably deviate off course and end up in places we never thought we would be.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979137\" id=\"p16\">This is true for individuals. It is also true for societies and nations. The scriptures are filled with examples.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979141\" id=\"p17\">The book of Judges records that after Joshua died, \u201cthere arose another generation \u2026 which knew not the Lord, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note7\"><sup class=\"marker\">7<\/sup><\/a><\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979145\" id=\"p18\">Despite the astonishing heavenly interventions, visitations, rescues, and miraculous victories the children of Israel witnessed during the lifetimes of Moses and Joshua, within a generation the people had abandoned the Way and began walking according to their own desires. And, of course, it did not take long before they paid the price for that behavior.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979149\" id=\"p19\">Sometimes this falling away takes generations. Sometimes it happens in a matter of years or even months.<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note8\"><sup class=\"marker\">8<\/sup><\/a> But we are all susceptible. No matter how strong our spiritual experiences have been in the past, as human beings we tend to wander. That has been the pattern from the days of Adam until now.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"147979153\" id=\"title4\">Here\u2019s the Good News<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"147979157\" id=\"p20\">But all is not lost. Unlike the wandering test subjects, we have reliable, visible landmarks that we can use to evaluate our course.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979161\" id=\"p21\">And what are these landmarks?<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979165\" id=\"p22\">Surely they include daily prayer and pondering the scriptures and using inspired tools like <cite>Come, Follow Me<\/cite>. Each day, we can approach the throne of God in humility and honesty. We can ponder our actions and review the moments of our day\u2014considering our will and desires in light of His. If we have drifted, we plead with God to restore us, and we commit to do better.<\/p>\n<img id=\"img3\" src=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/6a/6d/6a6d822595ea0327075ede73ce61eb0efda38e5f/he_leadeth_me_yongsung.png\" data-img-id=\"55bf69a722f911ecb34aeeeeac1e8d8a372992ba\" srcset=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/58/c6/58c673a5d55c1d0cb259d9172e31733c01d3bac0/he_leadeth_me_yongsung.png 60w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/32/aa/32aaaf4fc026d470cac5a029c89a381b411bb9e5/he_leadeth_me_yongsung.png 100w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/53/ae/53ae73462b28bc5b04017449708ec72e4a8bebd8/he_leadeth_me_yongsung.png 200w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/ed/5a/ed5a15fb35e6938d8ee550a8b33fb1776ecc9bac/he_leadeth_me_yongsung.png 250w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/00/2f/002f89d5745890e3f3564f75bf7d70ed472a6d0d/he_leadeth_me_yongsung.png 320w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/6a/6d/6a6d822595ea0327075ede73ce61eb0efda38e5f/he_leadeth_me_yongsung.png 500w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/43/5d/435d9cf120767b9967a8786b82544c453219e4cc/he_leadeth_me_yongsung.png 640w\" data-assetId=\"55bf69a722f911ecb34aeeeeac1e8d8a372992ba\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"323\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.5479876160990713\" alt=\"He Leadeth Me\"/>\n<p data-aid=\"147979169\" id=\"p23\">This time of introspection is an opportunity for recalibration. It is a garden of reflection where we can walk with the Lord and be instructed, edified, and purified by the written and Spirit-revealed word of our Heavenly Father. It is a sacred time when we remember our solemn covenants to follow the gentle Christ, when we assess our progress and align ourselves with the spiritual landmarks God has provided for His children.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979174\" id=\"p24\">Think of it as your personal, <em>daily restoration<\/em>. On our journey as pilgrims on the path of glory, we know how easy it is to fall away. But just as minor deviations can draw us out of the Savior\u2019s Way, so too can small and simple acts of realignment assuredly lead us back. When darkness creeps into our lives, as it often does, our daily restoration opens our hearts to heavenly light, which illuminates our souls, chasing away shadows, fears, and doubts.<\/p>\n<\/section>\n<section>\n<header>\n<h2 data-aid=\"147979178\" id=\"title5\">Small Rudders, Large Ships<\/h2>\n<\/header>\n<p data-aid=\"147979183\" id=\"p25\">If we seek it, surely \u201cGod shall give unto [us] knowledge by his Holy Spirit, yea, by the unspeakable gift of the Holy Ghost.\u201d<a class=\"note-ref\" href=\"#note9\"><sup class=\"marker\">9<\/sup><\/a> As often as we ask, He will teach us the Way and help us follow it.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979188\" id=\"p26\">This, of course, takes a steady effort on our part.

The <cite>NIV First-Century Study Bible<\/cite> contains this explanation: \u201cThe image of a path or way in the Hebrew Bible often stood for keeping the commandments or teachings of God [see <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/ot/ps/1.1?lang=eng#p1\">Psalm 1:1<\/a>; <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/ot/ps/16.11?lang=eng#p11\">16:11<\/a>; <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/ot/ps/86.11?lang=eng#p11\">86:11<\/a>]. This was a common ancient metaphor for active participation in a set of beliefs, teachings or practices. The Dead Sea Scrolls community called themselves followers of \u2018the way,\u2019 by which they meant they were followers of their own interpretation of the path that pleased God. Paul and the first Christians also called themselves \u2018follower[s] of the Way\u2019 [see <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/nt/acts/24.14?lang=eng#p14\">Acts 24:14<\/a>]\u201d (in \u201cWhat the Bible Says about the Way, the Truth, and the Life,\u201d Bible Gateway, biblegateway.com/topics/the-way-the-truth-and-the-life).<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979355\" id=\"note1_p2\">In 1873, an ancient book titled the <cite>Didache<\/cite> was discovered in the library of the patriarch of Jerusalem at Constantinople. Many scholars believe it was written and used in the late first century (AD 80\u2013100). The <cite>Didache<\/cite> begins with these words: \u201cTwo ways there are, one of life and one of death, but there is a great difference between the two ways. The way of life, then, is this: First, thou shalt love the God who made thee; secondly, thy neighbor as thyself\u201d (<cite>Teaching of the Twelve Apostles<\/cite>, trans. Roswell D.

The <cite>NIV First-Century Study Bible<\/cite> contains this explanation: \u201cThe image of a path or way in the Hebrew Bible often stood for keeping the commandments or teachings of God [see <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/ot/ps/1.1?lang=eng#p1\">Psalm 1:1<\/a>; <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/ot/ps/16.11?lang=eng#p11\">16:11<\/a>; <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/ot/ps/86.11?lang=eng#p11\">86:11<\/a>]. This was a common ancient metaphor for active participation in a set of beliefs, teachings or practices. The Dead Sea Scrolls community called themselves followers of \u2018the way,\u2019 by which they meant they were followers of their own interpretation of the path that pleased God.
