I feel your prayers and theirs.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979877\" id=\"p33\">Brothers and sisters, I am a native of the Kingdom of Tonga in the South Pacific but was raised in North America. The pandemic has kept hundreds, perhaps thousands of young Tongan missionaries serving around the world from returning to their beloved homeland because of its closed borders. Some Tongan elders have been on their missions for three years and sisters over two years! They wait patiently with the faith for which our people are known. Meanwhile, don\u2019t be too alarmed if some of them serving in your wards and stakes are looking increasingly more like me\u2014aging and gray. We\u2019re grateful for missionaries everywhere for their devoted service, even when longer or shorter than they had anticipated because of the pandemic.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979880\" id=\"p2\">One Sunday when I was a deacon, I was in the foyer with a tray of water passing the sacrament when a woman walked into the building. Dutifully, I approached and handed her the tray. She nodded, smiled, and took a cup of water. She had arrived too late to receive the bread. Shortly after this experience, my home teacher, Ned Brimley, taught me that many aspects and blessings of the gospel of Jesus Christ are given to us in sequential order.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979886\" id=\"p3\">Later that week, Ned and his companion came to our home with a memorable lesson. Ned reminded us that there was order to how God created the earth. The Lord took great care in explaining to Moses the order in which He created the earth. First, He started by dividing the light from the darkness, then water from dry land. He added plant life and animals before introducing to the newly formed planet His greatest creation: humankind, beginning with Adam and Eve.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979891\" id=\"p4\">\u201cSo God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. \u2026<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979897\" id=\"p5\">\u201cAnd God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good\u201d (<a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/ot/gen/1.27,31?lang=eng#p27\">Genesis 1:27, 31<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979900\" id=\"p6\">The Lord was pleased. And He rested on the seventh day.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979905\" id=\"p7\">The sequential order in which the earth was created gives us a glimpse not only of what is most important to God but also why and for whom He created the earth.<\/p>\n<img id=\"img1\" src=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/9c/5a/9c5a585722b1ab4257a006f8bda0cc18e6bcbe09/brimley_family_portrait.png\" data-img-id=\"5d3ef7c222f911ec9b75eeeeac1e708dbc929826\" srcset=\"https://assets.ldscdn.org/22/6e/226ec41150a94a67886d3ec5c684c01ee433ed82/brimley_family_portrait.png 60w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/79/b2/79b2d41d9e3feb9dd6a0c511af620e0dbf4759b2/brimley_family_portrait.png 100w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/23/ab/23aba96970b435eda9f317f018703ed06d556bf2/brimley_family_portrait.png 200w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/61/65/61653c7057ccd121da171348cf8bcc3bed6127f3/brimley_family_portrait.png 250w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/1e/aa/1eaaeb7998e0d2d51ff2d5bea58f1416e6a52956/brimley_family_portrait.png 320w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/9c/5a/9c5a585722b1ab4257a006f8bda0cc18e6bcbe09/brimley_family_portrait.png 500w,https://assets.ldscdn.org/49/cc/49ccc97b9bfdb43ddfd46267cce9ce172c53a98b/brimley_family_portrait.png 640w\" data-assetId=\"5d3ef7c222f911ec9b75eeeeac1e708dbc929826\" data-missing-asset=\"false\" data-width=\"500\" data-height=\"323\" data-aspect-ratio=\"1.5479876160990713\" alt=\"Brimley Family Portrait\"/>\n<p data-aid=\"147979910\" id=\"p8\">Ned Brimley punctuated his inspired lesson with a simple statement: \u201cVai, God\u2019s house is one of order. He expects you to live your life with order. In proper sequence. He wants you to serve a mission before you get married.\u201d To this point, Church leaders currently teach that \u201cthe Lord expects each able young man to prepare to serve. \u2026 Young women \u2026 who desire to serve should also prepare\u201d (<cite>General Handbook: Serving in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints<\/cite>, <span class=\"legacy-cross-ref\" data-legacy-href=\"../../../manual/general-handbook/24-preparing-and-recommending-missionaries.html\">24.0<\/span>, ChurchofJesusChrist.org). Brother Brimley continued: \u201cGod wants you to get married before you have children. And He wants you to continually develop your talents as you earn an education.\u201d If you choose to live your life out of sequence, you will find life more difficult and chaotic.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979915\" id=\"p9\">Brother Brimley also taught us that through His atoning sacrifice, the Savior helps us to restore order to our lives made chaotic or out of sequence by our own or others\u2019 poor choices.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979920\" id=\"p10\">From that time on, I\u2019ve had a fascination with \u201csequential order.\u201d I developed a habit of looking for sequential patterns in life and in the gospel.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979924\" id=\"p11\">Elder David A. Bednar taught this principle: \u201cAs we study, learn, and live the gospel of Jesus Christ, sequence often is instructive. Consider, for example, the lessons we learn about spiritual priorities from the order of the major events that occurred as the fulness of the Savior\u2019s gospel was restored in these latter days.\u201d<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979928\" id=\"p12\">Elder Bednar listed the First Vision and Moroni\u2019s initial appearance to Joseph Smith as teaching the boy prophet first, the nature and character of God, followed by the role the Book of Mormon and Elijah would play in gathering Israel on both sides of the veil in this last dispensation.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979932\" id=\"p13\">Elder Bednar concludes: \u201cThis inspiring sequence is instructive about the spiritual matters of highest priority to Deity\u201d (\u201c<a class=\"cross-ref\" href=\"/study/general-conference/2011/10/the-hearts-of-the-children-shall-turn?lang=eng&amp;para=3-8#p3\">The Hearts of the Children Shall Turn<\/a>,\u201d <cite>Ensign<\/cite> or <cite>Liahona<\/cite>, Nov. 2011, 24).<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979936\" id=\"p14\">One observation I\u2019ve made is that \u201csequential order\u201d is a simple, natural, and effective way for the Lord to teach us, as His children, important principles.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979940\" id=\"p15\">We\u2019ve come to earth to learn and gain experience we would not otherwise have. Our growth is unique to each of us individually and a vital component of Heavenly Father\u2019s plan. Our physical and spiritual growth begins in stages and develops slowly as we gain experience sequentially.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979946\" id=\"p16\">Alma gives a powerful sermon on faith\u2014drawing on the analogy of a seed, which, if tended and nourished properly, sprouts from a small sapling into a full-grown, mature tree that produces delicious fruit (see <a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.28-43?lang=eng#p28\">Alma 32:28\u201343<\/a>). The lesson is that your faith will increase as you give place for and nourish the seed\u2014or the word of God\u2014in your hearts. Your faith will increase as the word of God begins \u201cto swell within your breasts\u201d (<a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.28?lang=eng#p28\">verse 28<\/a>). That it \u201cswelleth, and sprouteth, and beginneth to grow\u201d (<a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/32.30?lang=eng#p30\">verse 30<\/a>) is both visual and instructive. It is also sequential.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979952\" id=\"p17\">The Lord teaches us individually according to our capacity to learn and how we learn. Our growth is dependent on our willingness, natural curiosity, level of faith, and understanding.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979958\" id=\"p18\">Nephi was taught what Joseph Smith would learn in Kirtland, Ohio, over 2,300 years later: \u201cFor behold, thus saith the Lord God: I will give unto the children of men line upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little; and blessed are those who hearken unto my precepts, and lend an ear unto my counsel, for they shall learn wisdom\u201d (<a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/28.30?lang=eng#p30\">2 Nephi 28:30<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979964\" id=\"p19\">That we learn \u201cline upon line, precept upon precept, here a little and there a little\u201d is again sequential.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979970\" id=\"p20\">Consider the following statements we\u2019ve heard most of our lives: \u201cFirst things first\u201d or \u201cFeed them milk before meat.\u201d How about \u201cWe have to walk before we run\u201d? Each of these axioms describes something that is sequential.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979976\" id=\"p21\">Miracles operate according to sequential order. Miracles occur when we first exercise faith. Faith precedes the miracle.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979982\" id=\"p22\">Young men are also ordained to offices of the Aaronic Priesthood in sequence, according to the age of the one being ordained: deacon, teacher, and then priest.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979988\" id=\"p23\">The ordinances of salvation and exaltation are sequential in nature. We are baptized prior to receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost. Temple ordinances are similarly sequential. Of course, as my friend Ned Brimley so wisely taught me, the sacrament is sequential\u2014it begins with the bread, followed by the water.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147979994\" id=\"p24\">\u201cAnd as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147980000\" id=\"p25\">\u201cAnd he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it;<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147980005\" id=\"p26\">\u201cFor this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sins\u201d (<a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/nt/matt/26.26-28?lang=eng#p26\">Matthew 26:26\u201328<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147980010\" id=\"p27\">In Jerusalem and in the Americas, the Savior instituted the sacrament in the exact same order.<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147980015\" id=\"p28\">\u201cBehold, mine house is a house of order, saith the Lord God, and not a house of confusion\u201d (<a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132.8?lang=eng#p8\">Doctrine and Covenants 132:8<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147980020\" id=\"p29\">Repentance is sequential. It begins with faith in Jesus Christ, even if just a particle. Faith requires humility, which is an essential element of having a \u201cbroken heart and a contrite spirit\u201d (<a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/2.7?lang=eng#p7\">2 Nephi 2:7<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147980025\" id=\"p30\">Indeed, the first four principles of the gospel are sequential. \u201cWe believe that the first principles and ordinances of the Gospel are: first, Faith in the Lord Jesus Christ; second, Repentance; third, Baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; fourth, Laying on of hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost\u201d (<a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/pgp/a-of-f/1.4?lang=eng#p4\">Articles of Faith 1:4<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147980030\" id=\"p31\">King Benjamin taught his people this important truth: \u201cAnd see that all these things are done in wisdom and order; for it is not requisite that a man should run faster than he has strength. And again, it is expedient that he should be diligent, that thereby he might win the prize; therefore, all things must be done in order\u201d (<a class=\"scripture-ref\" href=\"/study/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/4.27?lang=eng#p27\">Mosiah 4:27<\/a>).<\/p>\n<p data-aid=\"147980035\" id=\"p32\">May we live our lives with order and seek to follow the sequence the Lord has outlined for us. We will be blessed as we look for and follow the patterns and the sequence in which the Lord teaches what\u2019s most important to Him. In the sacred name of Jesus Christ, amen.<\/p>\n<\/div>",
